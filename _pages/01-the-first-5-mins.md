  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Of course — happy to.</div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Before we get into anything, I just want to be clear — this isn't a sales meeting.</div>

    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Okay, that's good to know.</div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">The reason I wanted to connect is pretty simple. I'm in the process of opening a new office here in Toronto, and part of that means getting to know people and understanding the community.</div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>

    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Yeah, that sounds fair.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Does that sound fair?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Yeah, absolutely.</div>
