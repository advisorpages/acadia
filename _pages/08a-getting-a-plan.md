Perfect. Tell me a bit about what you're already doing today. Are you currently investing on a monthly basis or is it more occasional?

## Gathering Information

All right. I think we've got everything we need to put your plan together.

## Final Questions

And I just have a few final questions to make sure we're aligned.

### Question 1: Implementation Commitment
First, if I can put together a plan that helps you reach your financial goals and fits comfortably within your budget, would you be open to implementing it at our next appointment?

> Yeah, I think so. Obviously, if it makes sense.

Great.

### Question 2: Referral Comfort
Second question, I know you already mentioned your brother Jose and your cousins Val and Eugene, but assuming you feel good about the work I do for you, would you be comfortable recommending me? A few more people like you? It's really important for me because it helps me grow my client base and will really help me start up my brokerage.

> Yeah, I can definitely help with that.
