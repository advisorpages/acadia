title: "Getting a Plan"

Speaker 1:
Fantastic.
Speaker 1:
What area of the financial house appealed to you the most?
Speaker 2:
Probably the investments and saving for our kids' education.
Speaker 1:
Perfect.
Speaker 1:
Tell me a bit about what you're already doing today.
Are you currently investing on a monthly basis, or is it more occasional?
Narrator:
Continue using your input sheet to collect the details of their current plan.
Speaker 1:
Alright — I think we've got everything we need to put your plan together.
Speaker 1:

I just have a few final questions to make sure we're aligned.
Speaker 1:

First — if I can put together a plan that helps you reach your financial goals and fits comfortably within your budget, would you be open to implementing it at our next appointment?
Speaker 2:
Yes.
Speaker 1:
Second — assuming you feel good about the work I do for you, would you be comfortable recommending me to ten or more people like yourselves?
Speaker 1:

That's important for me, because it helps me grow my client base and work toward opening my own brokerage over the next eighteen months.
Speaker 2:
Yeah, I'd be open to that.
Speaker 1:
And last — if the plan shows a gap between your current income and the goals you have for your family, would you be open to earning some extra part-time income working with us?
Speaker 2:
Possibly, yes.
Speaker 1:
Perfect.
Speaker 1:
It'll take me a few days to put everything together properly.
Speaker 1:
When would be a good time to follow up?
I have an opening this Tuesday or Thursday — would either of those work for you?
