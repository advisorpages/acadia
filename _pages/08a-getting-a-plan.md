  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Fantastic.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">What area of the financial house appealed to you the most?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Probably the investments and saving for our kids’ education.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Perfect.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Tell me a bit about what you’re already doing today. Are you currently investing on a monthly basis, or is it more occasional?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column narrator">Narrator:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Continue using your input sheet to collect the details of their current plan.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Alright — I think we’ve got everything we need to put your plan together.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">I just have a few final questions to make sure we’re aligned.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">First — if I can put together a plan that helps you reach your financial goals and fits comfortably within your budget, would you be open to implementing it at our next appointment?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Yes.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Second — assuming you feel good about the work I do for you, would you be comfortable recommending me to ten or more people like yourselves?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That’s important for me, because it helps me grow my client base and work toward opening my own brokerage over the next eighteen months.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Yeah, I’d be open to that.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">And last — if the plan shows a gap between your current income and the goals you have for your family, would you be open to earning some extra part-time income working with us?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Possibly, yes.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Perfect.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">It’ll take me a few days to put everything together properly.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">When would be a good time to follow up? I have an opening this Tuesday or Thursday — would either of those work for you?</div>
