Hey, thanks for meeting up. I really appreciate you taking the time. Before we get into anything, I just want to be clear. This isn't a sales meeting. The reason I wanted to connect is pretty simple. I'm in the process of opening a new office here in Toronto, and part of that means getting my name out there to advertise and share with others how I'm different than your typical financial advisor.

So today I'll share a bit about what I do. And if along the way someone comes to mind who you think I should meet, or someone that could use my help, I'd really appreciate an introduction. Would that be okay?

> Yeah, that sounds fair.
