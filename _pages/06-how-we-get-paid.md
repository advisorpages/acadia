title: "How We Get Paid - Presentation Skills"
---

Before we go any further, I think it's important to explain how we actually get paid.

Not as a pitch — just so you understand the model.

## Volume-Based Compensation

Everything we do is volume-based. That means the more people you help, and the more areas you help them with, the more you earn.

There's no salary and there's no hourly wage. You're paid based on the work you do and the value you bring.

## Compensation Breakdown

Here's what that looks like in real terms.

**Insurance Services** (life, home, auto, travel):
- Average compensation: about $500 per client

**Wills and Power of Attorney:**
- We work with a law firm
- When you refer a client, the law firm pays about $100

**Mortgages:**
- We refer clients to licensed lenders
- When a mortgage closes, the lender pays around $400

**Investment Services** (retirement accounts, tax-free savings, education plans):
- Average compensation: about $500 per client

## Realistic Earnings

Now, not every client needs help in every single area. Some people might just need insurance. Others might only need investments. Some need everything.

But when you help a family across multiple areas, it's very realistic to earn around $1,500 for that one family.

Even on the conservative side, most people average between $600 and $1,000 per client.

## Time Investment

Now here's the part that surprises most people.

Helping a client from start to finish usually takes between 4-6 hours total.

There are no quotas. You're not forced to sell anything. And most of the work can be done online.

## The Value Proposition

So let me ask you something. In your current job, how long does it take to earn $600?

For most people, that's several days of work.

Here, it's one family.

That doesn't make it easy — but it makes it clear.

That's the compensation model. Nothing hidden. Nothing complicated. Just paid for helping people solve real problems.
