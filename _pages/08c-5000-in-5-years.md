## The $5,000 in 5 Years Plan

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>But before we do that, I want to show you the business plan my broker shared with me about three years ago, the one that really got me focused on working here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>What appealed to me most about this business was the idea of passive income. Are you familiar with what passive income is?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>I've heard the term, but I don't actually know what it means.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>In simple terms. Passive income means the work you do today continues to pay you in the future. That's one of the main reasons people are drawn to finance. Very few industries offer that. You can almost think of it like building your own pension. Let me show you the plan. I used to work toward a $5,000 a month passive income over five years.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>When I sit down with a typical family, married kids, full time careers, they're usually saving about $500 a month between RRSP Tfsas and their kids education. But there are usually four big problems. First, they don't really know what they're invested in. They just know it's an RRSP or a TFSA. Second, they're unclear on their five year returns. Third, many haven't seen their advisor since the account was opened.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>And fourth, there's no written plan. When you educate clients and give them clarity and structure, they typically stop saving at the bank and start saving with you. Every time new money is deposited into the investment accounts we open. The investment companies pay us an average of about 2%. Sometimes it's a bit more, sometimes a bit less. But 2% is a good average.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Let me break that down. If a client redirects $500 a month and invest it through us, 2% of that is $10. By itself, that doesn't sound like much. But here's the key. Once people start monthly contributions, they usually don't stop it. It becomes automatic. Knowing that my goal was simple help just two clients per week with their investments.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>That's $500 times 2% times two clients, which equals $20. If I did that consistently for one year, 52 weeks, that added up to about $1,040 per month in passive income. And that's just from focusing on investments. An area where people desperately need guidance. Now take that same approach and continue it for five years, $1,040 multiplied by five years.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>That equals about $5,200 per month. I remember asking myself, how long would I have to work at my IT job to earn a pension paying me $5,200 a month? The answer was simple never. They didn't offer one. That's when this really clicked for me. So if this is a plan we could realistically build for you.
