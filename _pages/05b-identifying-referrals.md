So basically that's what my team and I do. We fix most people's money problems by looking at the big picture and creating a custom plan using tools our head office provides. Completely free for our clients. Pretty simple.

If you happen to run into someone who needs this—I'd really appreciate an introduction. Does anyone come to mind at all?

> Yeah. Me. We totally need one of these.

Oh, okay. For sure. I can put one together for you. I'll call you during the week to grab some information when I'm free. Outside of you, does anyone else come to mind?

> Maybe my brother and a few of my cousins.

What are their names?

> My brother is Jose. My cousins are Val and Eugene.

Great. I really appreciate that. What's the best way for me to connect with them? Can I give them a call?

> I think it might be best if I spoke to them first.

No problem. Maybe you could send them an email introducing me instead. That way it's easier for you. Would you be okay with that?

> Okay. Yeah. That's a better.
