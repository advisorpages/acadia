## The Key Question

    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>Everyone reacts to this differently, which is totally fine. Let me ask you the most important question out of everything I shared with you today. What stood out to you the most?</td>

- Getting a plan
- Making some extra money as a side gig
- A little bit of both
- Or is it more that you're thinking about people, you know, who could use this kind of help?

    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>Honestly, probably a bit of both.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Fantastic. What area of the financial house appealed to you the most?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Probably the investments and saving for our kids education.</td>
