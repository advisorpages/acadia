For most people, that's several days of work. And here it's one family. So that's the full picture. No hype, no guarantees. Just how it actually works in real life.

## The Key Question

Everyone reacts to this differently, which is totally fine. Let me ask you the most important question out of everything I shared with you today. What stood out to you the most?

- Getting a plan
- Making some extra money as a side gig
- A little bit of both
- Or is it more that you're thinking about people, you know, who could use this kind of help?

> Honestly, probably a bit of both.

> Probably the investments and saving for our kids education.
