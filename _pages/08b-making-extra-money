<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That’s awesome.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Earlier, you mentioned wanting more time — to travel more and be more present at home.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Is it fair to say that’s the main reason you’re open to learning more about joining the team?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Yes.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">If that were to happen, how much extra income do you think you’d need each month for that to feel real?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Probably about two thousand dollars a month.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That’s fair.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">What we’ll do next is schedule a separate meeting to build out a more formal business game plan.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">I’ll walk you through our ninety-day training system in more detail, and I’ll also introduce you to my broker — she’s the one who signs off on all new hires.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">But before we do that, I want to show you the business plan my broker shared with me about three years ago — the one that really got me focused on working here.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">What appealed to me most about this business was the idea of passive income.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Are you familiar with what passive income is?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Not really.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">In simple terms, passive income means the work you do today continues to pay you in the future.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That’s one of the main reasons people are drawn to finance — very few industries offer that.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">You can almost think of it like building your own pension.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Let me show you the plan I used to work toward a five-thousand-dollar-a-month passive income over sixty months.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">When I sit down with a typical family — married, kids, full-time careers — they’re usually saving about five hundred dollars a month between RRSPs, TFSAs, and their kids’ education.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">But there are usually four big problems.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">First — they don’t really know what they’re invested in. They just know it’s an RRSP or a TFSA.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Second — they’re unclear on their five-year returns.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Third — many haven’t seen their advisor since the account was opened.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">And fourth — there’s no written plan.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">When you educate clients and give them clarity and structure, they typically stop saving at the bank and start saving with you.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Every time new money is deposited into the investment accounts we open, the investment companies pay us an average of about two percent.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Sometimes it’s a bit more, sometimes a bit less — but two percent is a good average.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Let me break that down.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">If a client redirects five hundred dollars a month and invests it through us, two percent of that is ten dollars.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">By itself, that doesn’t sound like much.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">But here’s the key — once people start monthly contributions, they usually don’t stop. It becomes automatic.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Knowing that, my goal was simple: help just two clients per week with their investments.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That’s five hundred dollars times two percent, times two clients — which equals twenty dollars.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">If I did that consistently for one year — fifty-two weeks — that added up to about one thousand forty dollars per month in passive income.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">And that’s just from focusing on investments — an area where people desperately need guidance.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Now take that same approach and continue it for five years.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">One thousand forty dollars multiplied by five years equals about fifty-two hundred dollars per month.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">I remember asking myself — how long would I have to work at my IT job to earn a pension paying me fifty-two hundred dollars a month?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">The answer was simple — never. They didn’t offer one.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That’s when this really clicked for me.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">So if this is a plan we could realistically build for you, would you be interested in learning more about our ninety-day training system?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Yes.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Perfect.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Why don’t you swing by the office this Thursday at seven p.m.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">I’ll introduce you to the team, and we’ll walk through the game plan together.</div>
</div>
