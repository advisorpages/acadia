Before we dive in, tell me a bit about yourself. What do you do for work exactly?

> I'm a nurse at a Toronto General Hospital. I've been doing that for ten years now.

What do you like most about your current career?

> I like that the work actually matters. I'm helping people and there's a real sense of purpose to it.

If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change it?

> Definitely the hours and the shifts can be long and unpredictable. And we're so understaffed that we can never get enough help. Honestly, I'd want more life balance so I can spend more time with the family.

Do you have any kids? How old are they?

> Yes, three kids. They're ten, seven and five years old.

That's great. You must have your hands full. If time and money were no issue at all. What would you and your family do differently? What would that kind of freedom look like for you?

> I think I'd slow things down a bit. Spend more time together without worrying about schedules or money. Travel more. Be more present. And feel confident that our kids future is taken care of.

I understand. When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?

> Honestly, not any time soon. At least not on its own.

Do you have someone right now who handles your financial planning other than yourselves?

> No. We mostly handle things on our own, but we don't really have a clear plan.
