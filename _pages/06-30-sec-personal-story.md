Speaker 1:
For the next part, I want to share a bit about how we actually get paid.
Speaker 1:
As I mentioned earlier, my goal is to open my own branch within the next eighteen months. I want you to understand the model clearly — not as a pitch — but so you can explain it to others if it ever comes up.
Speaker 1:
Before I do that though, let me quickly share how I got into this business, because I was definitely not interested in finance at first.
Speaker 1:
I was a new graduate working in IT, and around that time I started noticing how frustrated my parents were with their money.
Speaker 1:
They had insurance they didn't fully understand, their finances were scattered, and honestly, they were being taken advantage of without realizing it.
Speaker 1:
A friend of mine offered to put together a proper financial plan for them — not to sell anything — just to organize everything.
Speaker 1:
When I saw that plan, it really clicked.
Speaker 1:

For the first time, my parents had clarity, structure, and real peace of mind. They knew exactly where they stood and what they needed to do next.
Speaker 1:

That's when I realized two things.
Speaker 1:

First — how powerful this kind of planning really is.
Speaker 1:

And second — that helping people this way could also create a meaningful part-time income.
Speaker 1:

That income helped me start saving for my own home, and eventually gave me a clear path to stop working altogether within about five years — simply by focusing on the investment side of the business.
Speaker 1:

So with that context, let me walk you through, at a high level, how we get paid when we help a family across all areas of their financial house.
