## Volume-Based Compensation

Everything we do is volume based. That means the more people we help, the more we earn. There's no salary and there's no hourly wage. You're paid based on the work you do and the value you bring.

Here's what that looks like in real terms:

### Insurance (Life, Home, Auto, Travel)
Average payout is about $500 per client.

### Wills and Power of Attorney
We work with a law firm. When you refer a client, the law firm pays about $100.

### Mortgages
We refer clients to licensed lenders. When a mortgage closes, the lender pays around $400.

### Investment Services (Retirement accounts, Tax-free savings, Education plans)
Average pay is about $500 per client.

## Realistic Earnings

Now, not every client needs help in every single area. Some people might just need insurance. Others might only need investments. Some need everything. But when you help a family across multiple areas, it's very realistic to earn around $1,500 for that one family.

Even on the conservative side, most people average between $600 and $1,000 per client.

## Time Investment

Here's the part that surprises most people: helping a client from start to finish usually takes between 4 to 6 hours total.

There are no quotas. You're not forced to sell anything, and most of the work can be done online. So let me ask you something. In your current job, how long does it take to earn $1,000?

> Probably a few days.
