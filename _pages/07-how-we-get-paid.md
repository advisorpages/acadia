    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Everything we do is volume based. That means the more people we help, the more we earn. There's no salary and there's no hourly wage. You're paid based on the work you do and the value you bring.</td>

### Mortgages

## Realistic Earnings

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>Now, not every client needs help in every single area. Some people might just need insurance. Others might only need investments. Some need everything. But when you help a family across multiple areas, it's very realistic to earn around $1,500 for that one family.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Even on the conservative side, most people average between $600 and $1,000 per client.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Time Investment

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>Here's the part that surprises most people: helping a client from start to finish usually takes between 4 to 6 hours total.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>There are no quotas. You're not forced to sell anything, and most of the work can be done online. So let me ask you something. In your current job, how long does it take to earn $1,000?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Probably a few days.</td>
    </tr>
