title: "How We Get Paid"
---

Speaker 1:
Everything we do is volume-based. That means the more people we help, the more we earn.
Speaker 1:
There's no salary and there's no hourly wage. You're paid based on the work you do and the value you bring.
Compensation Breakdown
Speaker 1:
Here's what that looks like in real terms.
Speaker 1:
Insurance — life, home, auto, and travel.
Average payout is about five hundred dollars per client.
Speaker 1:

Wills and power of attorney.
We work with a law firm.
When you refer a client, the law firm pays about one hundred dollars.
Speaker 1:

Mortgages.
We refer clients to licensed lenders.
When a mortgage closes, the lender pays around four hundred dollars.
Speaker 1:

Investment services — retirement accounts, tax-free savings, and education plans.
Average pay is about five hundred dollars per client.
Speaker 1:

Now, not every client needs help in every single area.
Speaker 1:

Some people might just need insurance.
Others might only need investments.
Some need everything.
Speaker 1:

But when you help a family across multiple areas, it's very realistic to earn around fifteen hundred dollars for that one family.
Speaker 1:

Even on the conservative side, most people average between six hundred and one thousand dollars per client.
Speaker 1:

Now here's the part that surprises most people.
Speaker 1:

Helping a client from start to finish usually takes between four and six hours total.
Speaker 1:

There are no quotas.
You're not forced to sell anything.
And most of the work can be done online.
The Value Proposition
Speaker 1:

So let me ask you something.
Speaker 1:

In your current job, how long does it take to earn one thousand dollars?
Speaker 2:
Probably a few days.
Speaker 1:
For most people, that's several days of work.
Speaker 1:
Here — it's one family.
