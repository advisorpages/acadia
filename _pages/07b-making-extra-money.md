When someone shows interest in the business opportunity or seems like they'd be a good fit for the team:

## Identifying Potential Partners

Look for people who are:
- Motivated and goal-oriented
- Good with people and communication
- Interested in learning and personal growth
- Looking for flexibility or additional income
- Natural helpers or teachers

## Recruitment Approach

1. **Plant the seed** - "You know, some people who go through this process realize they'd actually be great at helping others with their finances. Have you ever considered anything like that?"

2. **Share the opportunity** - "We're actually expanding our team here in Toronto. We look for people who enjoy helping others and want more control over their income and schedule."

3. **Explain the business model** - "It's similar to a financial advisor role, but we focus on the complete financial picture rather than just products. The training is comprehensive, and you can start part-time while keeping your current position."

## Key Points to Emphasize

- **Comprehensive training program** - "You don't need previous financial experience. We have a structured training program that covers everything."
- **Flexibility** - "You can build this around your current schedule. Many people start part-time."
- **Income potential** - "Compensation is based on the families you help. Our average is $600-1000 per family, and you can help 1-2 families per week once you're established."
- **Support system** - "You'd be part of our team with ongoing support and mentorship."

## Sample Conversation

"You mentioned you enjoy [their profession/hobby]. One of the things I love about this business is that it attracts people who are natural teachers and helpers. The skills you've developed in [their field] would actually transfer really well.

Would you be open to learning more about what we do? I'd be happy to introduce you to my manager for a casual conversation. No pressure at all - just a chance to see if this might be a good fit for you."

## Next Steps

- Schedule a meeting with you and your manager
- Have them review basic business information
- Discuss training timeline and income expectations
- Explain the licensing process if applicable
