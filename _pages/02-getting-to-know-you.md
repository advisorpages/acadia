title: "Getting to Know You"

Speaker 1:
So, before we dive in… tell me a bit about yourself.
Speaker 2:
Sure. I'm married, we have three kids, and we own a home here in Toronto.
Speaker 1:
What do you do for work?
Speaker 2:
I'm a nurse at a hospital here in the city. I've been doing that for several years now.
Speaker 1:
What do you like most about your current career?
Speaker 2:
I like that the work actually matters. I'm helping people, and there's a real sense of purpose to it.
Speaker 1:
If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change?
Speaker 2:
Definitely the hours. The shifts can be long and unpredictable, and I'd want more balance so I can spend more time with my family.
Speaker 1:
Do you have any kids? How old are they?
Speaker 2:
Yes — three kids. They're ten, seven, and five, so they're still pretty young.
Speaker 1:
That's great. You must have your hands full.
Speaker 1:
So if time and money were no issue at all… what would you and your family do differently?
What would that kind of freedom look like for you?
Speaker 2:
We'd slow things down a bit. Spend more time together without worrying about schedules or money.
Travel more, be more present, and feel confident that our kids' future is taken care of.
Speaker 1:
I understand.
Speaker 1:
When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?
Speaker 2:
Honestly, not anytime soon — at least not on its own.
Speaker 1:
Do you have someone right now who handles your financial planning, other than yourselves?
Speaker 2:
No. We mostly handle things on our own, but we don't really have a clear plan.
