title: "Getting to Know You"

So, before we dive in... tell me more about yourself:

What do you do for work?

What do you like most about your current career?

If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change?

Do you have any kids? How old are they if you don't mind me asking?

If time and money were no issue at all... what would you and your family do differently? What would that freedom look like for you guys?

When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?

Do you have someone right now who handles your current financial needs other than yourselves?
