      <td>The strategy here is High Posture. You are offering a service that changes lives (fixing the "Financial House") and a business opportunity that builds passive income. If they don't want it, you move to referrals. Do not convince; sort.</td>

## Category 1: The Client Objections (Getting the Plan)

### 1. "I already have a financial advisor/I’m with the bank."

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"I already have a financial advisor/I’m with the bank."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> They probably do, but as you pointed out in Script 05a, they likely don't have a written plan or know their debt freedom date.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "That’s great. I assume they’ve already given you a written plan to be debt-free and maximize your government grants? If not, let me just give you a second opinion. If you’re in good shape, I’ll tell you. If I find gaps, I’ll help you fix them. Fair?"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 2. "How much does this cost me?"

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"How much does this cost me?"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> As per Script 07, the companies pay you, not the client.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "It doesn't cost you anything out of pocket. Just like a mortgage broker, the financial institutions pay my brokerage directly. You get the plan and the service for free."</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 3. "I don't have any money to invest right now."

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"I don't have any money to invest right now."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> This is exactly why they need the "Financial House" fixed (Foundation/Debt).<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "That’s exactly why we need to meet. My job isn't just investing; it’s freeing up cash flow. We focus on the foundation—debt and budgeting—first. Let’s find that money."</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 4. "Is my money safe? I’ve never heard of your company."

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"Is my money safe? I’ve never heard of your company."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> You use tools from a head office and refer to licensed lenders/insurers.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "We don't hold your money. We deal with the same major institutions you already know (like TD, Manulife, RBC, etc.). We just act as the broker to get you a better plan and lower fees."</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 5. "I’m too busy/Can you just email me the info?"

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"I’m too busy/Can you just email me the info?"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> Script 02 emphasizes the need for a conversation to get a clear picture.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "I can’t email a diagnosis without doing the check-up. It only takes 20 minutes to see if I can help. I have an opening Tuesday or Thursday—which works better?"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Category 2: The Recruiting Objections (Meeting the Broker)

### 6. "I’m not a salesperson."

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"I’m not a salesperson."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> Script 06 positions this as education and planning, not pushing products.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "Good. I’m not looking for salespeople; I’m looking for educators. We don't push products; we teach people how money works. If you can follow a script and help families, you can do this."</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 7. "I don’t have time for a second job."

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"I don’t have time for a second job."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> Script 08b mentions passive income and building a pipeline.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "I’m not asking for 40 hours a week. I’m talking about a few hours to build passive income. If you continue doing what you’re doing now, will you ever have the time freedom you want? If not, you need to look at this."</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 8. "Is this a pyramid scheme?"

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"Is this a pyramid scheme?"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> You are licensed, regulated, and deal with government compliance.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "No. Pyramid schemes are illegal and don't have real products. We are a government-regulated financial brokerage dealing with mortgages, insurance, and investments. It’s a franchise model, like real estate."</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 9. "I need to think about it."

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"I need to think about it."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Reality:</strong> Indecision kills momentum.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "That’s fair. But usually, 'thinking about it' just means you have a specific concern. What is the one thing holding you back from just meeting my broker to hear the details?"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Category 3: The Pivot (The "No")

### 10. "I’m just not interested." (The Shut Down)

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td style="width: 15%;">Client</td>
      <td>"I’m just not interested." (The Shut Down)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Maintain posture. If they aren't a client or a recruit, they are a source of clients and recruits. Do not beg.<br><br><strong>The Simple Response:</strong> "No problem at all. I appreciate you being upfront. Since this isn't for you, I’m sure you know people who do need help getting out of debt or saving for their kids."<br><br><strong>The Action:</strong> Immediately transition to Script 05b: "Who are two people you know who are hardworking but maybe stressed about money?"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Summary of Posture

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>If they hesitate on the Plan: "It's a second opinion. You have nothing to lose."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>If they hesitate on the Business: "Come meet the broker. If you don't like it, you never have to come back."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>If they say No: "Who do you know?" (Get the referral and move on).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
