## Problem 1: Scattered Finances

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>First problem, their finances are scattered over eight different companies, like each company has a different agent with their own agenda. A life insurance agent wants to sell you the biggest policy possible. The bank wants to increase your credit limit. No one is looking at the full picture. It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Problem 2: No Written Plan

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>Second problem, there's no written plan. In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debt, improve your investments, and save money on insurance?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Not a chance. They never do that!</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>All the savings we find get redirected into their goals and dreams, like vacations or family experiences with the people you recommend to me. Do you think they would be upset if I was able to do this for them?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Of course not.</td>
