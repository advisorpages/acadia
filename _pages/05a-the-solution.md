  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">There are two big problems with this that aren't obvious.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">First problem — their finances are scattered over eight different companies.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Each company has a different agent with their own agenda.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">A life insurance agent wants to sell you the biggest policy possible.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">The bank wants to increase your credit limit.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">No one is looking at the full picture.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Second problem — there's no written plan.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debt, improve your investments, and save money on insurance?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Oh my goodness. They never do that.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Exactly. The Solution</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">So here's what my team and I can do for the people you refer to me by putting together a plan.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Typically, I can cut their insurance costs in half.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Put a will and power of attorney in their hands for about two hundred dollars.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Get them completely out of debt with a mortgage in twenty years.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">And improve their investment returns — averaging roughly six to nine percent in the long term.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">All the savings we find get redirected into their goals and dreams — like vacations or family experiences.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">With the people you refer, would they be upset if I was able to do this for them?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Of course not.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">So basically, that's what my team and I do.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">We fix most people's money problems by looking at the big picture and creating a custom plan using tools our head office provides — completely free for our clients.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Pretty simple.</div>
</div>
