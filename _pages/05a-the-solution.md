There are two big problems with this that aren't obvious.

## Problem 1: Scattered Finances

First problem, their finances are scattered over eight different companies, like each company has a different agent with their own agenda. A life insurance agent wants to sell you the biggest policy possible. The bank wants to increase your credit limit. No one is looking at the full picture. It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing.

## Problem 2: No Written Plan

Second problem, there's no written plan. In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debt, improve your investments, and save money on insurance?

> Not a chance. They never do that!

## Our Solution

Exactly. So here's what my team and I can do for the people you refer to me. By putting together a plan, typically I can:

- Cut their insurance costs in half
- Put a will and power of attorney in their hands for about $200
- Get them completely out of debt with a mortgage in 20 years
- Improve their investment returns, averaging roughly 6% to 9% in the long term

All the savings we find get redirected into their goals and dreams, like vacations or family experiences with the people you recommend to me. Do you think they would be upset if I was able to do this for them?

> Of course not.
