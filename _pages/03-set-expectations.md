Thanks for sharing that. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this simple. Usually one of three things happens in meetings like this, so I'm going to explain what I do.

## Three Possible Outcomes

1. **Introductions** - Along the way you might think of someone who could really use the help. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.

2. **Team Building** - I'm in the process of building a team, so if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with us, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.

3. **Financial Assessment** - You might already be in good shape financially, but if there's one area that catches your attention and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.

No pressure. Either way, you decide. Is that okay?

> Yeah, that's okay.
