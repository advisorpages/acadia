## Three Possible Outcomes

1.  **Introductions** - Along the way you might think of someone who could really use the help. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.

2.  **Team Building** - I'm in the process of building a team, so if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with us, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.

3.  **Financial Assessment** - You might already be in good shape financially, but if there's one area that catches your attention and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.

      <td>No pressure. Either way, you decide. Is that okay?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Yeah, that's okay.</td>
    </tr>
