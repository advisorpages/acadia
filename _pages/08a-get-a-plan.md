### Question 1: Implementation Commitment
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>First, if I can put together a plan that helps you reach your financial goals and fits comfortably within your budget, would you be open to implementing it at our next appointment?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Yeah, I think so. Obviously, if it makes sense.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Great.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Question 2: Referral Comfort
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>Second question, I know you already mentioned your brother Jose and your cousins Val and Eugene, but assuming you feel good about the work I do for you, would you be comfortable recommending me? A few more people like you? It's really important for me because it helps me grow my client base and will really help me start up my brokerage.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Yeah, I can definitely help with that.</td>
    </tr>
