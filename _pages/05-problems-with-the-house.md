If you look at this, you're probably thinking that every bank and financial advisor in Canada does this. How is this any different and why would anyone want to pick me? It's not obvious, but there's a bunch of problems with this house. Let me give you a few examples.

## Example: The Insurance Problem

Let's take a real example. We have a family paying $300 a month to Industrial Alliance.

That is a serious amount of money. But here is the problem. Like almost everyone we meet, they don't actually know what they bought. They are paying all that cash, but they have very little coverage. It's not even enough to pay off the mortgage, let alone leave money for the kids. The sad truth is most people own the wrong type of insurance with the wrong beneficiaries.

Why? Because they were sold a policy by an agent who cared more about a commission cheque than what was right for the family.

## The Emergency Fund Problem

When it comes to an emergency fund and budgeting, this family is left to figure it out on their own. And as a result, they never get around to it. This is really important because their house suddenly needed a $9,000 roof replacement.

Where would they find the money?

> Probably from a credit card.

That's right. Or maybe a line of credit. Having an emergency fund in a written budget actually helps you stay out of debt.

## The Legal Documents Problem

When it comes to a will, we all go to a lawyer to get one made. Most people agree it's important to have one, but very few actually do because it costs around $1,000 to get one made on this level.

## The Debt Freedom Problem

Let's say they have a mortgage and line of credit with TD Bank plus credit cards with Capital One. Most families don't know their debt freedom date—the exact date they'll be completely out of debt. They often assume it will be when the mortgage is paid off in 25 years. But they forget about the loans, lines of credit and credit cards.

The worst part is that no one wants to help with paying off debt instead, and everyone is focused on increasing your credit limit.

## The Investment Problem

On the retirement side, they've put money into RRSPs and TFSAs with TD wealth and they're part of a group pension with Manulife. But the problem is they're not really sure about their investment performance or what exactly they own.

They're left to figure it out alone, thinking they're doing fine with a 3% to 5% return when they could actually be doing a lot better.

## The Education Savings Problem

For their kids education, they have an account with RBC. Sadly, many families aren't getting help from government grants and bonds that are meant for education. It's not because they can't get it. It's because they don't know about it.

Instead, they're putting their money in a regular savings account when they could be getting free money.

## The Goals and Dreams Problem

And the last part of the house is the roof—the goals and dreams that we find. Almost every family we meet with is so overwhelmed with the rest of their financial house that they skip goals like annual family trips or starting a business they've always dreamed of.

Like I said earlier, there has to be more to life than just paying the bills, right?

> Yes, I totally agree.
