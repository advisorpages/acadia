title: "Problems with the House"
---

Speaker 1:
If you look at this, you're probably thinking that every bank and financial advisor in Canada does this. Why would anyone want to pick me and my team?
Speaker 1:
It's not obvious, but there's a bunch of problems with this house.
Speaker 1:
Let me give you a few examples.
Insurance Gaps
Speaker 1:
Let's say this family has life insurance paying $300 per month. Experts suggest having coverage that's at least ten times your annual income.
Speaker 1:

However, many families don't even have enough life insurance to pay off their mortgage if something were to happen to them.
Speaker 1:

When it comes to an emergency fund and budgeting, this family is left to figure it out on their own. And as a result, they never get around to it.
Speaker 1:

This is really important because if their house suddenly needed a $9,000 roof replacement, where would they find the money?
Speaker 2:
Probably from a credit card.
Speaker 1:
That's right. Or maybe a line of credit.
Speaker 1:
Having an emergency fund and a written budget actually helps you stay out of debt.
Missing Legal Documents
Speaker 1:
When it comes to a will, we all go to a lawyer to get one made.
Speaker 1:
Most people agree it's important to have one, but very few actually do — because it costs around $1,000 to get one made on this level.
Debt Without an End Date
Speaker 1:
Let's say they have a mortgage and line of credit with TD Bank, plus credit cards with Capital One and Amex.
Speaker 1:
Most families don't know their debt freedom date — the exact date they'll be completely out of debt.
Speaker 1:
They often assume it will be when the mortgage is paid off in 25 years. But they forget about the loans, lines of credit, and credit cards.
Speaker 1:
The worst part is that no one wants to help with paying off debt.
Speaker 1:
Instead, everyone is focused on increasing your credit limit.
Investment Confusion
Speaker 1:
On the retirement side, they've put money into RRSPs and TFSAs with TD Wealth, and they're part of a group pension with Manulife.
Speaker 1:
But the problem is they're not really sure about their investment performance or what exactly they own.
Speaker 1:
They're left to figure it out alone — thinking they're doing fine with a three to five percent return — when they could actually be doing a lot better.
Missed Opportunities
Speaker 1:
For their kids' education, they have an account with RBC.
Speaker 1:
Sadly, many families aren't getting help from government grants and bonds that are meant for education.
Speaker 1:
It's not because they can't get it — it's because they don't know about it.
Speaker 1:
Instead, they're putting their money in a regular savings account when they could be getting free money.
Skipping Goals and Dreams
Speaker 1:
And the last part of the house is the roof — the goals and dreams.
Speaker 1:
We find almost every family we meet with is so overwhelmed with the rest of their financial house that they skip goals like annual family trips, or starting a business they've always dreamed of.
Speaker 1:
Like I said earlier — there has to be more to life than just paying the bills, right?
Speaker 2:
Yes. I totally agree.
The Two Biggest Problems
Speaker 1:
There are two big problems with this that aren't obvious.
Speaker 1:
First problem — their finances are scattered over eight different companies.
Speaker 1:
Each company has a different agent with their own agenda.
Speaker 1:
A life insurance agent wants to sell you the biggest policy possible.
Speaker 1:
The bank wants to increase your credit limit.
Speaker 1:
No one is looking at the full picture.
Speaker 1:
It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing.
Speaker 1:
Second problem — there's no written plan.
Speaker 1:
In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debt, improve your investments, and save money on insurance?
Speaker 2:
Oh my goodness. They never do that.
Speaker 1:
Exactly.
The Solution
Speaker 1:
So here's what my team and I can do for the people you refer to me by putting together a plan.
Speaker 1:
Typically, I can cut their insurance costs in half.
Speaker 1:
Put a will and power of attorney in their hands for about two hundred dollars.
Speaker 1:
Get them completely out of debt with a mortgage in twenty years.
Speaker 1:
And improve their investment returns — averaging roughly six to nine percent in the long term.
Speaker 1:
All the savings we find get redirected into their goals and dreams — like vacations or family experiences.
Speaker 1:
With the people you refer, would they be upset if I was able to do this for them?
Speaker 2:
Of course not.
Speaker 1:
So basically, that's what my team and I do.
Speaker 1:
We fix most people's money problems by looking at the big picture and creating a custom plan using tools our head office provides — completely free for our clients.
Speaker 1:
Pretty simple.
Speaker 1:
So if you happen to run into someone who needs this, I'd really appreciate an introduction.
Speaker 1:
Does anyone come to mind at all?
Speaker 2:
Yeah. Me. We totally need one of these.
Speaker 1:
Oh, okay. For sure. I can put one together for you.
Speaker 1:
What's your number? I'll call you during the week to grab some information when I'm free.
Speaker 2:
Yeah — it's four one six, five five five, one two three four.
Speaker 1:
Great. Thanks.
Speaker 1:
Outside of you — does anyone else come to mind?
Speaker 2:
Maybe my brother and a few of my cousins.
Speaker 1:
What are their names?
Speaker 2:
My brother is Jose. My cousins are Val and Eugene.
Speaker 1:
Great. I really appreciate that.
Speaker 1:
What's the best way for me to connect with them? Can I give them a call?
Speaker 2:
I think it might be best if I spoke to them first.
Speaker 1:
No problem.
Speaker 1:
Maybe you could send them an email introducing me instead. That way it's easier for you.
Speaker 1:
Would you be okay with that?
Speaker 2:
Okay. Yeah. That's a better idea.
Speaker 1:
Great. Again — I really appreciate it.
