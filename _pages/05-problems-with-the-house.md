  <div class="dialogue-column">If you look at this, you're probably thinking that every bank and financial advisor in Canada does this. Why would anyone want to pick me and my team?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">It's not obvious, but there's a bunch of problems with this house.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Let me give you a few examples.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="subheading">Insurance Gaps</h2>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Let's say this family has life insurance paying $300 per month. Experts suggest having coverage that's at least ten times your annual income.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">However, many families don't even have enough life insurance to pay off their mortgage if something were to happen to them.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">When it comes to an emergency fund and budgeting, this family is left to figure it out on their own. And as a result, they never get around to it.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">This is really important because if their house suddenly needed a $9,000 roof replacement, where would they find the money?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Probably from a credit card.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That's right. Or maybe a line of credit.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Having an emergency fund and a written budget actually helps you stay out of debt.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="subheading">Missing Legal Documents</h2>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">When it comes to a will, we all go to a lawyer to get one made.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Most people agree it's important to have one, but very few actually do — because it costs around $1,000 to get one made on this level.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="subheading">Debt Without an End Date</h2>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Let's say they have a mortgage and line of credit with TD Bank, plus credit cards with Capital One and Amex.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Most families don't know their debt freedom date — the exact date they'll be completely out of debt.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">They often assume it will be when the mortgage is paid off in 25 years. But they forget about the loans, lines of credit, and credit cards.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">The worst part is that no one wants to help with paying off debt.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Instead, everyone is focused on increasing your credit limit.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="subheading">Investment Confusion</h2>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">On the retirement side, they've put money into RRSPs and TFSAs with TD Wealth, and they're part of a group pension with Manulife.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">But the problem is they're not really sure about their investment performance or what exactly they own.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">They're left to figure it out alone — thinking they're doing fine with a three to five percent return — when they could actually be doing a lot better.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="subheading">Missed Opportunities</h2>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">For their kids' education, they have an account with RBC.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Sadly, many families aren't getting help from government grants and bonds that are meant for education.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">It's not because they can't get it — it's because they don't know about it.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Instead, they're putting their money in a regular savings account when they could be getting free money.</div>
</div>

<h2 class="subheading">Skipping Goals and Dreams</h2>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">And the last part of the house is the roof — the goals and dreams.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">We find almost every family we meet with is so overwhelmed with the rest of their financial house that they skip goals like annual family trips, or starting a business they've always dreamed of.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Like I said earlier — there has to be more to life than just paying the bills, right?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Yes. I totally agree.</div>
</div>
