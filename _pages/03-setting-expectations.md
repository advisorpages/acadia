Speaker 1:
Thanks for sharing that. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this simple.
Speaker 1:
Usually, one of three things happens in meetings like this.
Speaker 1:
One — I explain what I do, and along the way, you might think of someone who could really use the help. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.
Speaker 1:
Two — I'm in the process of building a team. So if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with us, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.
Speaker 1:
Three — you might already be in good shape financially. But if there's one area that catches your attention, and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.
Speaker 1:
No pressure either way. You decide. Is that okay?
Speaker 2:
Yeah, that's okay.
