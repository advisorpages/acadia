Thanks for sharing that. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this simple.

Usually, one of three things happens in meetings like this.

1) I explain what I do, and along the way, you might think of someone who could really use the help. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.

2) I'm in the process of building a team. So if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with us, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.

3) You might already be in good shape financially. But if there's one area that catches your attention, and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.

No pressure either way. You decide. Is that okay?
