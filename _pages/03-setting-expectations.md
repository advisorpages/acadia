Thanks for sharing that.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this simple.

I'm going to share a little bit about what I do and usually one of three things typically happen:

1) You might think of someone who could use some help with their finances. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.

2) I'm hiring and in the process of opening uo my own branch. So if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with me, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.

3) You might already be in good shape financially. But if there's one area that catches your attention, and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.

No pressure either way. You decide. Is that okay?
