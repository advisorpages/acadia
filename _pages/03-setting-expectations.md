<div class="dialogue-container">
<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Thanks for sharing that. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this simple.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Usually, one of three things happens in meetings like this.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">One — I explain what I do, and along the way, you might think of someone who could really use the help. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Two — I'm in the process of building a team. So if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with us, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Three — you might already be in good shape financially. But if there's one area that catches your attention, and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">No pressure either way. You decide. Is that okay?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Yeah, that’s okay.</div>
</div>
