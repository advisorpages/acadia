# Presentation Skills Training Framework

## Overview

This presentation framework is designed to guide you through delivering a simple, duplicatable presentation broken up into digestible parts. The goal is to **pique interest**, **get them a plan**, and **recruit them onto the team**.

## Presentation Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Pique Interest**: Capture their attention and show the value of financial planning
- **Get a Plan**: Help them see the need for a written financial plan
- **Recruit**: Invite qualified prospects to join the team

### Key Strategy
It's possible to sign them up immediately, but if you're not confident, default to introducing them to the team. This approach builds trust and creates multiple pathways for engagement.

## Presentation Framework

This is a **casual 30-minute presentation** structured into clear, sequential sections:

## How to Use This Framework

### Presentation Flow
1. **Start casually** - No pressure, just getting to know people
2. **Build value** - Show problems and solutions
3. **Present options** - Multiple pathways to engage
4. **Close naturally** - Guide to appropriate next step

### Success Metrics
- **Interest Level**: Are they engaged and asking questions?
- **Plan Request**: Do they want a financial plan?
- **Team Interest**: Are they open to the business opportunity?

### Default Strategy
When in doubt, default to introducing them to the team rather than pushing for immediate signup. This maintains the casual, low-pressure approach while still creating potential for future engagement.
