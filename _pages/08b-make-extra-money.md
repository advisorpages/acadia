## Final Question: Income Opportunity

## Scheduling Follow-up

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>It'll take me a few days to put everything together properly to go over your formal plan. I have an opening this Monday or Wednesday. Would any of those days work for you?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>I'll be free on Wednesday.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Great. I have a 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. opening. Would any of those times work for you?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>I should be good for 8 p.m..</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Great. I have it in my calendar. I'll send you an invite as well. That's awesome. Earlier you mentioned wanting more time to travel more and be more present at home. Is it fair to say that's the main reason you're open to learning more about joining the team?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Yeah, I think so.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>If that were to happen, how much extra income do you think you'd need each month for that to feel real?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Probably about $2,000 a month.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>That's fair. What we'll do next is schedule a separate meeting to build out a more formal business game plan. I'll walk you through our 90-day training system in more detail, and I'll also introduce you to my broker, Vanessa. She's the one who signs off on all new hires. But before we do that, I want to show you the business plan my broker shared with me about three years ago, the one that really got me focused on working here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>What appealed to me most about this business was the idea of passive income. Are you familiar with what passive income is?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>I've heard the term, but I don't actually know what it means.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>In simple terms. Passive income means the work you do today continues to pay you in the future. That's one of the main reasons people are drawn to finance. Very few industries offer that. You can almost think of it like building your own pension. Let me show you the plan. I used to work toward a $5,000 a month passive income over five years.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>When I sit down with a typical family, married kids, full time careers, they're usually saving about $500 a month between RRSP Tfsas and their kids education. But there are usually four big problems. First, they don't really know what they're invested in. They just know it's an RRSP or a TFSA. Second, they're unclear on their five year returns. Third, many haven't seen their advisor since the account was opened.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>And fourth, there's no written plan. When you educate clients and give them clarity and structure, they typically stop saving at the bank and start saving with you. Every time new money is deposited into the investment accounts we open. The investment companies pay us an average of about 2%. Sometimes it's a bit more, sometimes a bit less. But 2% is a good average.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Let me break that down. If a client redirects $500 a month and invest it through us, 2% of that is $10. By itself, that doesn't sound like much. But here's the key. Once people start monthly contributions, they usually don't stop it. It becomes automatic. Knowing that my goal was simple help just two clients per week with their investments.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>That's $500 times 2% times two clients, which equals $20. If I did that consistently for one year, 52 weeks, that added up to about $1,040 per month in passive income. And that's just from focusing on investments. An area where people desperately need guidance. Now take that same approach and continue it for five years, $1,040 multiplied by five years.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>That equals about $5,200 per month. I remember asking myself, how long would I have to work at my IT job to earn a pension paying me $5,200 a month? The answer was simple never. They didn't offer one. That's when this really clicked for me. So if this is a plan we could realistically build for you. Would you be interested in learning more about our 90 day training system?</td>

    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Yeah, absolutely.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Perfect. Why don't you swing by the office this Thursday at 7 p.m.? I'll introduce you to the team and we'll walk through the game plan together.</td>
