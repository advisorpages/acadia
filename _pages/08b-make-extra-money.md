## Final Question: Income Opportunity

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>And last question, if the plan shows a gap between your current income and the goals you have for your family, would you be open to earning some extra part-time income working with us?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Possibly. Let's see how this goes first.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Great. That's all I'm asking for.</td>
    </tr>

## Scheduling Follow-up

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 15%;">You</td>
      <td>It'll take me a few days to put everything together properly to go over your formal plan. I have an opening this Monday or Wednesday. Would any of those days work for you?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>I'll be free on Wednesday.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Great. I have a 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. opening. Would any of those times work for you?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>I should be good for 8 p.m..</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>Great. I have it in my calendar. I'll send you an invite as well. That's awesome. Earlier you mentioned wanting more time to travel more and be more present at home. Is it fair to say that's the main reason you're open to learning more about joining the team?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Yeah, I think so.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>If that were to happen, how much extra income do you think you'd need each month for that to feel real?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="client-row">
      <td>Client</td>
      <td>Probably about $2,000 a month.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>You</td>
      <td>That's fair. What we'll do next is schedule a separate meeting to build out a more formal business game plan. I'll walk you through our 90-day training system in more detail, and I'll also introduce you to my broker, Vanessa. She's the one who signs off on all new hires.</td>
