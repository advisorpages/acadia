  <div class="dialogue-column">One thing I notice with most people is that their money is kind of spread out everywhere. Different banks. Different accounts. Different advice.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">So what I do is pretty simple. I help people organize everything into one clear structure that's easy to understand and follow.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">The easiest way to picture it is like a house. I call it a financial house.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Just like a real house, every part has a purpose. And some parts matter more than others.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">You'd agree the foundation is the most important part, right?</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Yeah, for sure.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">In your finances, that foundation is protecting income. Because if income disappears, everything else stops mattering.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">In that moment, people aren't thinking about retirement or long-term plans. They're thinking, “How do we pay the mortgage?”</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">That's why income protection is the foundation of the house.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">The next level is the basics.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Emergency fund. Simple budget. Will and power of attorney.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">These are the things that keep everything stable when life throws a surprise.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">After that, we focus on getting rid of debt, and planning for retirement and kids' education.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">And at the very top — the roof of the house — are your goals and dreams.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Trips. Freedom. Time.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Because there really has to be more to life than just paying bills.</div>
</div>
