From a client side, what I do is really simple. I help people organize their money into one clear structure that's easy to understand and follow. The easiest way to look at it is like a financial house, just like a real house—every part has a purpose and some parts matter more than others. You'd agree the foundation is the most important part, right?

> Yeah, for sure.

## Foundation: Income Protection

In your finances, that foundation is protecting your income. Because if your income suddenly disappears, the last thing your family is thinking about is how to save for retirement. They're more concerned about how to pay the mortgage and put food on the table. That's why financial experts all agree that life insurance or income protection is the foundation of the house.

## Basics: Emergency Fund and Legal Documents

The next level is an emergency fund, budget, will and power of attorney. These are often forgotten, but really important because these are things that keep everything stable when life throws a surprise.

## Structure: Wealth Building

After that, we focus on getting rid of debt and planning for retirement and kids education.

## Roof: Goals and Dreams

And at the very top, the roof of the house—are your goals and dreams. These are fun things like trips, freedom and more time because there really has to be more to life than just paying bills.

Has anyone explained structuring your finances like this before?

> Kind of, but not exactly the same way you just did.
