The 5-Step Presentation Flow 

1. The Opener – Break the ice
Establish professional boundaries and remove pressure immediately.

Thanks for meeting with me – I really appreciate your time. We’re meeting today because I could use your help – I was asked by my broker (RVP) to open a new financial branch in Toronto – before I can do that, I need roughly 500 clients and 20-30 agents as a minimum. Today I want to share a little bit about what I do – perhaps you might be able to point me in the right direction and maybe introduce me to the right people.

Would that be okay?

Person 2: Absolutely.
 
2. Use the Client Survey to Get to know the person you’re talking to.

Before we get into it – tell me a little bit about yourself.

What do you do for work?
What do you like about your current career?
If you had the power to change it, what would you change?
Are you making all that you want to make? How much more would you like to earn if you can?

Do you have any kids? 
How old?
(need more questions)

If time and money were no issue, what would you and your family do differently?

When will your current career allow you to accomplish these things?

Do you have someone right now who handles your current financial needs other than yourselves?


 

3. Set the expectations

Thanks for sharing. 
I know you’re busy and let me get into it.

Before explaining more about what I do - typically 1 of 3 things happen on these meetings.

1)	I will be sharing some ways I help people with their money - If some people come to mind, I’d love the opportunity to meet these people and would appreciate an introduction.
2)	I mentioned earlier I’m looking to open up my own branch over the next few months and I need a minimum of 20-30 agents to work with me. If someone you know comes to mind who’d be a good fit, I’d love the opportunity to do a phone interview with this person.
3)	You probably already have your finances in order and making all the money you want to make BUT if there’s a particular area that catches your attention, I’d love the opportunity to try and earn your accounts – but that’s your decision at the end of the day.

Is that okay?

Person 2: Yes for sure.

(If you’re training someone – change the verbiage to position your trainee as the one who you are grooming to open the branch.)
 
4. What I Do. (The Financial House)

00;00;00;00 - 00;00;20;04
Speaker 1
On the client side, I often notice that people's money is spread out everywhere, making it difficult for them to manage. I help them by setting up a simple structure that's really easy to follow. Basically, I build financial houses for people. It's like creating your dream home, but instead for money. Just like a regular house. Each floor and each room has its own priority, with some being more important than others.

00;00;20;14 - 00;00;23;19
Speaker 1
You'd agree that the foundation is probably the most crucial part, right?

00;00;23;27 - 00;00;25;27
Speaker 2
Yeah, sure. That makes sense.

00;00;26;07 - 00;00;44;23
Speaker 1
In finance, experts all agree that life insurance is the foundation of a financial house. If something happens to you and your income disappears, your family won't be thinking about things like retirement. They'll be scrambling, trying to figure out how to pay the mortgage without the proper type and amount of life insurance. The rest of the financial plan won't matter because the family is suddenly in survival mode.

00;00;44;25 - 00;01;04;15
Speaker 1
That's why life insurance is the foundation of the home. It's needed to replace the income of a loved one in case they die. The second floor of the financial House includes an emergency fund, a budget, a will and power of attorney. These are important for keeping your finances safe and ready for any surprises. The next floor level is getting rid of debts, then planning for retirement and kids education.

00;01;04;15 - 00;01;19;26
Speaker 1
And finally, the roof of the house is your goals and dreams. Because there has to be more to life than just paying the bills. Right. If you look at this, you're probably thinking that every bank and financial advisor in Canada does this. Why would they want to pick me and my team? It's not obvious, but there's a bunch of problems with this house.

00;01;19;29 - 00;01;37;15
Speaker 1
Let me give you a few examples. Let's say this family has life insurance with sun life paying $300 per month. Experts suggest having coverage that's at least ten times your annual income. However, many families don't even have enough life insurance to pay off their mortgage if something were to happen to them. When it comes to an emergency fund and budgeting.

00;01;37;18 - 00;01;47;17
Speaker 1
This family is left to figure it out on their own and as a result, they never get around to it. This is really important because if their house suddenly needed a $9,000 roof replacement, where would they find the money?

00;01;47;24 - 00;01;49;11
Speaker 2
Probably from a credit card.

00;01;49;19 - 00;02;05;19
Speaker 1
That's right. Or maybe a line of credit. Having an emergency fund and written budget actually helps you stay out of debt. When it comes to a well, we all go to a lawyer to get one made. Most people agree it's important to have one, but very few actually do because it costs around $1,000 to get one made on this level.

00;02;05;20 - 00;02;21;24
Speaker 1
Let's say they have a mortgage and line of credit with TD Bank plus credit cards with Capital One and Amex. Most families don't know their debt freedom date, the exact date they'll be completely out of debt. They often assume it will be when the mortgage is paid off in 25 years. But they forget about the loans. Lines of credit and credit cards.

00;02;21;26 - 00;02;39;17
Speaker 1
The worst part is that no one wants to help with paying off debt. Instead, everyone is focused on increasing your credit limit. On the retirement side, they've put money into RRSP and Tfsas with TD wealth and they're part of a group pension with Manulife. But the problem is they're not really sure about their investments performance or what exactly they own.

00;02;39;19 - 00;02;57;04
Speaker 1
They're left to figure it out alone, thinking they're doing fine with a 3 to 5% return on investment when they could actually be doing a lot better for their kids education. They have an account with RBC. Sadly, many families aren't getting help from government grants and bonds that are meant for education. It's not because they can't get it, but because they don't know about it.

00;02;57;04 - 00;03;14;11
Speaker 1
Instead, they're putting their money in a regular savings account when they could be getting free money. And the last part of the house is the roof for the goals and dreams we find. Almost every family we meet with is so overwhelmed with the rest of their financial house, they skip goals like annual family trips, or maybe starting a business they've always dreamed of.

00;03;14;12 - 00;03;17;29
Speaker 1
Like I said earlier, there has to be more to life than just paying the bills, right?

00;03;18;08 - 00;03;20;11
Speaker 2
Yes, I totally agree.

00;03;20;20 - 00;03;38;08
Speaker 1
There's two big problems with this. That's not obvious. The first problem is their finances are scattered over eight different companies and each company has a different agent with their own agenda. For example, if you were to meet with a life insurance agent, their main objective is to sell you the biggest policy they can offer. They don't care if you have debt or if you have a will.

00;03;38;10 - 00;03;54;01
Speaker 1
If you go to the bank, their agenda is to get you into a new credit card or consolidate your debts into a line of credit. They don't really care if you have a will or life insurance. It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing. And the second problem is there's no written plan.

00;03;54;11 - 00;04;02;08
Speaker 1
In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debts, make the most of your investments, and save money on insurance?

00;04;02;16 - 00;04;04;24
Speaker 2
Oh, my goodness. They never do that.

00;04;05;00 - 00;04;20;28
Speaker 1
Exactly. So here's what my team and I can do for the people you refer to me by putting together a plan. Typically, I can cut their insurance costs in half, put a will and power of attorney in their hands for about $200. Get them completely out of debt with a mortgage in 20 years and get them a better return on all their investments.

00;04;20;29 - 00;04;34;17
Speaker 1
Averaging roughly 6 to 9% in the long term. Also, all the savings we find by reorganizing their financial house, we put into their goals and dreams like a vacation fund or something like that. With the people you refer, be upset if I was able to do this for them haha.

00;04;34;25 - 00;04;35;21
Speaker 2
Of course not.

00;04;36;06 - 00;04;52;19
Speaker 1
So basically that's what my team and I do. We fix most people's money problems by looking at their finances on a big picture and create a custom plan to fix it using tools. Our head office provides us entirely free for our clients. Pretty simple. So if you happen to run into someone who needs this, I'd really appreciate an introduction.

00;04;53;00 - 00;04;54;12
Speaker 1
Does anyone come to mind at all?

00;04;54;22 - 00;04;57;16
Speaker 2
Yeah. Me. We totally need one of these.

00;04;57;26 - 00;05;04;18
Speaker 1
Oh, okay. For sure. I can put one together for you. What's your number? I'll call you during the week to grab some information when I'm free.

00;05;04;28 - 00;05;09;23
Speaker 2
Yeah, it's 4165, five, five. One, two, three, four.

00;05;10;01 - 00;05;13;14
Speaker 1
Great. Thanks. Outside of you. Does anyone else come to mind at all?

00;05;13;24 - 00;05;16;06
Speaker 2
Maybe my brother and a few of my cousins.

00;05;16;17 - 00;05;17;12
Speaker 1
What are their names?

00;05;17;23 - 00;05;21;16
Speaker 2
My brother is Jose. My cousins are Val and Eugene.

00;05;21;25 - 00;05;26;08
Speaker 1
Great. I really appreciate that. What's the best way for me to connect with them? Can I give them a call?

00;05;26;18 - 00;05;29;04
Speaker 2
I think it might be best if I spoke to them first.

00;05;29;15 - 00;05;37;27
Speaker 1
No problem. Instead, maybe you could send them an email introducing me instead. It might be less awkward and I don't want you doing too much work. Would you be okay to do that?

00;05;38;07 - 00;05;40;15
Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. That's a better idea.

00;05;40;21 - 00;05;54;27
Speaker 1
Great. Again, I appreciate it. You can also help by looking out for people who might want to join our team and help solve money problems for others are hiring. Manager is doing phone interviews in the next few weeks and we'd love to meet anyone you think of. Let me show you how we get paid so you can tell others.

00;05;55;01 - 00;06;19;23
Speaker 1
It all depends on volume. The bigger the transaction, the more you make. On average, for insurances like life, home, auto and travel. You earn about $500 per client for referring wills. The law firm pays about $100 for referring mortgages. The lenders pay about $400 for retirement investments like RRSP and TFSAS and kids education plans like RRSP, you earn about $500.

00;06;19;27 - 00;06;36;10
Speaker 1
So for helping a family with everything you can earn around $1,500 per client. Realistically, you might not help everyone in all areas, but you can still expect to make about $600 to $1000 per client. How long does it take for the average person to make a minimum of $600 in their job today?

00;06;36;19 - 00;06;38;21
Speaker 2
That's easily four days worth of work.

00;06;38;24 - 00;06;59;17
Speaker 1
Exactly. To help a client from end to end takes 4 to 6 hours and they can choose their own hours. No quotas, and they'll have the option to do it all online through Zoom. Now, my hiring manager isn't looking for just anyone. She wants a very specific type of person. We're looking for someone who is a good salesperson or good at teaching others, someone who is enthusiastic, ambitious or motivated.

00;06;59;27 - 00;07;01;11
Speaker 1
Does anyone like that come to mind?

00;07;01;21 - 00;07;04;02
Speaker 2
So what does this person need to do exactly?

00;07;04;11 - 00;07;08;29
Speaker 1
Basically, just put plans together using the tools that the company gives us. Do you have someone in mind?

00;07;09;10 - 00;07;15;01
Speaker 2
Honestly, I think I might be interested in this, but I want to learn more about it before committing to anything.

00;07;15;07 - 00;07;27;18
Speaker 1
Oh, okay. That's fine. I think it's best for you to talk to the hiring manager, Jeanette, so she can answer all your questions. She handles everything. She's doing phone interviews this week, so it would be good to speak with her. If I can set up a meeting, would you join the call?

00;07;27;28 - 00;07;29;09
Speaker 2
Yes, absolutely.

00;07;29;19 - 00;07;31;20
Speaker 1
Is it okay if I pass on your number to her?

00;07;32;00 - 00;07;34;02
Speaker 2
Yeah, sure. That would be okay.

00;07;34;14 - 00;07;36;26
Speaker 1
Aside from you, is there anyone else who comes to mind?

00;07;37;05 - 00;07;43;11
Speaker 2
Yeah. I was thinking about my cousin Tony and my brother in law, Sam. I think they'd be really good at this.

00;07;43;22 - 00;07;47;19
Speaker 1
Okay, great. What's the best way to get a hold of them? Is it okay if I give them a call?

00;07;47;29 - 00;07;50;28
Speaker 2
Yeah, that should be okay. I'll text you their number.





 
4. The Sort (The "Fork in the Road")
Goal: Let them qualify themselves so you don't have to guess.

"Out of everything I just shared, what appealed to you the most right now?"
Fixing your own Financial House? (Client)
Becoming a Partner to earn extra income?" (Recruit)
Or, does none of this apply to you, but you know people who desperately need this help?" (Referrer)


 
5. Pick Your Path (The Close)
Strict Rule: Do not mix the paths. Once they pick, stay in that lane.

Path A: The Client (Focus: The FNA)
Transition immediately to gathering FNA data.
•	Transition: "Fantastic. What area of the financial house appealed to you the most?
•	Action: Collect the FNA data using the questionnaire.
•	Next steps: It takes me about 48 hours to complete a plan from end to end. Let's book 45 minutes on [Day] at [Time] to review it.

Path B: The Partner (Focus: Recruit)
Show them how working with you can fix the question they answered in the client survey 
“If time and money were no issue, what would you and your family do differently?”

Meet your RVP – Invite to the office to show they are not alone. – Complete the gameplan with RVP

Leave them with an idea virus – something that’s planted in their mind curious to come out to the office. 

•	Transition: That’s awesome – Let me show you one of the reasons that got me excited about joining the team.
•	Action: Show them how they can make $5000 per month in 60 months through investments.

•	The Math: "If you help just 4 families a month set up a $500 savings plan..." (Show the commission math).
•	The Tie-Down: "You mentioned you needed $2,000 for [Goal from Step 2]. That is just helping 4 families a month. Is that amount of work worth the reward?"
•	Next Step: "I want you to meet my Broker, [Name]. They run the office. Come see the environment, and if it feels right, we can start your background check."


There’s a lot of areas of finance we focus on but if you just focused on one area – you can generate passive income. Basically that means doing work today so you don’t have to tomorrow. This is almost like a pension and one of the reasons people decide to become financial advisors.

Let me show you one of the reasons that got me excited about joining the team.

When I sit with someone that's married or married, they're aged 25 or older. They've got kids, they're a homeowner, and they have a job or an occupation and a career that pays them at least $50,000 a year.

If I look at that level of demographics, the typical family in this case, they save and they put away about $500 a month. And that's not uncommon because if you break it down for our RRSPs, let's say retirement registered retirement savings plans are as fees people are putting away about $200. So it's about $100 per year per couple upper per partner.

They put away tax free, tax free savings accounts. Okay. And they're they're putting away $200 as well. And they're obviously sometimes they're putting away education plans for kids. So our spouse and they're doing about $100 there. So if you take a look at that entire thing, that's kind of usually how the $500 is broken down. Now, there's a problem, though, with most people we sit with.

They have the accounts all set up. They're doing the right things. But I ask for very simple questions. Anytime I sit with someone who has some sort of investment, the first question I ask them is, you know, what is it that you own? Exactly. So you've got our RRSPs. You got to forces, you got RSP, all that. But what do you actually own?

If you open up the hood, you pop open the hood of the car? What is it that you are putting your money into every single month? And they're not sure, really. So and you know, this is very common is that they just they put the money away. They think the RSP is the product. That's not true. That's something that you put into the products.

00:04:15:20 - 00:04:36:24
Speaker 1
So they're not sure what they own. Okay. That's number one. The second thing the second question I ask is what kind of returns have you had? And they can't answer that. They can tell you what their returns are over the last statement. But if you look at the if I ask them, you know, what's your rolling five year return?

00:04:37:08 - 00:04:55:19
Speaker 1
They can't answer it. So they're not really sure of the returns. Okay. That's the second challenge. And, you know, if you're putting money away, you want to know if it's doing right or wrong. Like if it's if you're on the right track or on the wrong track, they can't really answer. The third thing I asked them is, when was the last time you saw your advisor?

00:04:56:14 - 00:05:14:08
Speaker 1
And most of the time nowadays I'm giving people that well, I don't I don't have an advisor and there's no one guiding them. Or if they do have an advisor, they haven't seen them since the account was open. And that's generally a challenge for the most part. Now, this is different. If they're not reaching out to them, that's that's generally what we see.

00:05:14:21 - 00:05:32:17
Speaker 1
But sometimes you got the people that they're they are reaching out to them and they just don't call back, which I get a lot of. Right. But I'm calling them and I'm trying to service them. But the most part, most people nowadays don't have an advisor. There's no guidance. Right. And the fourth thing is they have no plan.

00:05:32:17 - 00:05:53:03
Speaker 1
And I asked them, do you have a written plan? What you want this particular money to do? You put away $200 a month into your RRSPs. What are you aiming for? You've got $100 a month going into your kids education plan. What do you want that to do for you? And the answer that I always get is, I just want a good return.

00:05:53:11 - 00:06:16:09
Speaker 1
And sometimes you don't need a good return to attain a specific goal. You need a consistent return and they can't answer those things. So generally, let me sit with someone. This is what we see. And there's a huge disconnect and there's a huge demand because almost everyone we sit with when I ask them these questions, this is exactly what I got.

00:06:16:17 - 00:06:36:20
Speaker 1
So there's a massive opportunity. And when I was taking a look at this over a decade ago and I decided I was going to do a bit of a career change, I saw, look, this is an opportunity if I just focus on this one area, I could I could build them. I could basically build my own pension. So give you a scenario here we sit with a client.

00:06:36:20 - 00:06:53:05
Speaker 1
We answer those questions. They realize, oh, my goodness, I didn't even know that. I'm like, I'm not doing the right things. So they say, Look, Anthony, just take this five I like. I'll stop it with the bank. I'm not going to give you Anthony, the my entire life savings, but I'll stop this $500 and I'll do it with you.

00:06:53:18 - 00:07:16:03
Speaker 1
And if you don't do a good job, I'm moving the money back. And that's a fair deal that I usually have with people. So if I sit if I if I help this one client, this one client, we get paid roughly about 2% of all the money that comes in. Actually, we put the 2% there. Okay. So we get paid 2% on the money that we transfer.

00:07:16:11 - 00:07:51:24
Speaker 1
So when that translates to 2% of $500 is $10, the around here is $10. Now that's $10. Every time they deposit the 500 and most time people are doing $500 a month. So every time they put the 500, that's $10. So that's a $10 passive income, if you want to say. And if we help two clients and my goal was working the evenings and the weekends, I could help two clients a week and two clients will pay me $20 a week just in this scenario.

00:07:52:00 - 00:08:12:22
Speaker 1
Okay. And if you multiply that, if you if you if I continue that and this is what I was thinking, if I continue that for 52 weeks, for one year, right. Any 52 weeks times 20, that's a thousand, 41,000, $40 a month paid to me possibly. And I looked at that. I'm like, crap, that's not bad. This is it.

00:08:13:02 - 00:08:27:23
Speaker 1
At the time that this was like a quarter of my paycheck or less than a quarter of my paycheck, and I'm like, should if I work hard for one year and I just get good at one area in an area that everyone needs help in, I could I could really I could really help a lot of people here.

00:08:27:23 - 00:08:50:18
Speaker 1
So and I can I can make a great passive income. I'm all for working hard and stopping eventually one day. But what I didn't like was the idea was that working in the call center, I'd have to take I'd have to work for 30 years to get maybe something at the end of the day, a pension. So I saw this and I started doing this, and I got close to a thousand bucks and I'm like, this is amazing.

00:08:50:19 - 00:09:07:26
Speaker 1
Like, I'm getting paid passively. My clients are happy. And when you have happy clients and you have people that are like people that you service that are happy, they naturally refer you to others, right? So that's kind of what happened. And my plan was like, if I do this for five years and I just help to clients a week for five years.

00:09:08:10 - 00:09:32:25
Speaker 1
So that's 1040. I'm a year is what I would do and I continue doing that for five years. That's 50 $200 a month and that's mortgage paid off automatically. And this passive guy's right, people who start putting money away, they forget about it. So this case, it's 50 $200 a month personally. And that was something that I was super excited about.

00:09:34:09 - 00:09:53:10
Speaker 1
This is I wouldn't have to work 30 years for a pension to do this. And especially nowadays, this is this is better than most pensions that are available today. And most companies now aren't offering pensions. So this is a way to generate passive income, whether you're you know, you're thinking about retirement and you need a constant cash flow coming in.

00:09:53:19 - 00:10:11:12
Speaker 1
This is a very stable way to generate passive without having to fork up a lot of capital. Okay. Now, this is if I did this personally. Okay? And, you know, you get to a point where, you know, I decided, look, I'll be a broker because if I start teaching people this stuff, I think I could change their life.

00:10:12:00 - 00:10:30:08
Speaker 1
So when I decided that I was going to become a broker, there's an incentive for us to develop people that do the same. So I started thinking, look, if I teach someone this exact game plan that I'm that I, I showed here right now, and I focus on building a team and let's say we just focus right now, just one person.

00:10:30:21 - 00:11:10:14
Speaker 1
Now, if I teach them to make 1040, okay, they make that money, right? What head office is going to do is they're going to pay me 30% of that volume, which comes up to an extra 312 bucks. That's $312. It's just make this cleaner 312 bucks. Okay. So every time I teach someone to make a thousand head office will pay me about 300 bucks.

00:11:10:16 - 00:11:49:19

Okay. And if they stick to the same plan and they start making 5200, so they make 5200. Right. Head office is going to pay me $1,560 a month as I thank you or a kickback for servicing them. So I started thinking that and I'm like, if I started, if I just built a team of ten that do that, that's $15,600 a month working in a in an industry that people really need their help, they need the guidance.

And in one product line, guys, keep in mind here, I'm not even including all the other stuff that comes in. A lot of times they have home an auto insurance. They have these ancillary these side products that, hey, by the way, do you know a mortgage broker? Yeah, I could refer you to one. And then there's money generated there.

They have mortgage insurance. They don't know how it works or their policy's renewing and they need to get a renewal done, that kind of stuff. They pass it on. So this is 15,000 by focusing on building a team, teaching them the same thing that I'm doing and this is why I got I got involved in the industry is I realize I'm going to have to work hard sooner or later and I might as well work towards something that will pay me even when I stop working.

So this was my pension plan. This plan was the thing that, you know, I feel that most people need. So, guys, thank you for watching this video. If you happen to know anyone like I will, I'm looking to build a bigger team. I'm looking at opening up a second branch.

Obviously there's an incentive for me to do it and I would definitely guide them to the right way. Also, from a client perspective, guys, if there's anyone that you know that's kind of in this area, love to meet them as well. So I hope this kind of made sense a little bit. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.

💡 3 Training Tips for Your Team
1.	Don't "Sell" in Step 3: Teach them that Step 3 is just explaining how it works, not asking the prospect to buy yet. This lowers anxiety.
2.	Silence is Golden: In Step 4 (The Sort), teach them to ask the question and then shut up. Let the prospect break the silence.
3.	The "Connector" is a Win: Make sure your team knows that getting a "Connector" (Referral source) is a victory, not a failure. It keeps the relationship alive.
