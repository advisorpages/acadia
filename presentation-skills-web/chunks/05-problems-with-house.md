At this point, most people are thinking, "Isn't this what everyone does?" And on the surface, it looks that way.

But once you zoom out, there are a few common problems we see over and over again.

### Insurance Gaps

A family might have life insurance, they're paying for it every month, but if you actually look at the coverage, it's often not enough to replace income or even pay off the mortgage.

So technically, they're insured. But practically, they're still exposed.

### Emergency Planning

When it comes to emergency savings and budgeting, most families are left to figure that out on their own. And because no one walks them through it, it usually gets pushed to the side.

Then something unexpected happens and the money comes from a credit card or line of credit. Not because people are careless — but because there was never a plan.

### Missing Legal Documents

It's similar with wills. Most people agree they're important. But because they feel expensive or complicated, they get delayed.

### Debt Without End Date

Most families don't actually know the exact date they'll be debt-free. They assume it's when the mortgage ends, and forget about everything else. And instead of helping people eliminate debt, most advice focuses on managing it.

### Investment Confusion

On the investment side, people are usually doing the right things. They're saving, they have accounts set up. But if you ask simple questions like, "What do you actually own?" or "How has this performed over time?" Most people aren't sure.

### Missed Opportunities

With kids' education, we see the same pattern. Money is being saved, but many families miss out on grants or incentives simply because no one explained them.

### The Two Biggest Issues

When everything else feels overwhelming, the roof of the house — the goals and dreams — gets pushed aside.

1. **Everything is spread across multiple companies and multiple advisors.** Each one focuses on their piece, but no one is coordinating the whole picture. It's hard to move forward when the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.

2. **There's no written plan.** Quick question: In all the years you've worked with financial institutions, how many times has someone sat down with you and given you a clear, written plan for everything?
