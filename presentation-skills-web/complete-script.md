## 1. The Opener

Hey, thanks for meeting up. I really appreciate you taking the time.

Before we get into anything, I just want to be clear — this isn't a sales meeting.

The reason I wanted to connect is pretty simple. I'm in the process of opening a new office here in Toronto, and part of that means getting to know people and understanding the community.

So today, I'll share a bit about what I do. And if along the way someone comes to mind who you think I should meet, or someone you think could use help, that's really all I'm looking for.

Does that sound fair?

## 2. Getting to Know You

So, before we dive in... I'd love to understand a bit more about your situation. Let me ask you a few questions to get to know you better.

**What do you do for work?**

**That's interesting. What do you like most about your current career?**

**If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change?**

**Are you making all that you want to make right now? If there's a gap, how much more would you like to be earning?**

**Do you have any kids? How old are they if you don't mind me asking?**

**If time and money were no issue at all... what would you and your family do differently? What would that freedom look like for you guys?**

**When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?**

**Do you have someone right now who handles your current financial needs other than yourselves?**

## 3. Setting Expectations

Thanks for sharing that. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this simple.

Usually, one of three things happens in conversations like this.

### First Outcome

I explain what I do, and along the way, you might think of someone who could really use the help. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.

### Second Outcome

I'm in the process of building a team. So if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with us, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.

### Third Outcome

You might already be in good shape financially. But if there's one area that catches your attention, and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.

No pressure either way. You decide. Is that okay?

## 4. The Financial House

One thing I notice with most people is that their money is kind of spread out everywhere. Different banks. Different accounts. Different advice.

So what I do is pretty simple. I help people organize everything into one clear structure that's easy to understand and follow.

The easiest way to picture it is like a house. I call it a financial house.

Just like a real house, every part has a purpose. And some parts matter more than others.

You'd agree the foundation is the most important part, right?

**Speaker 2:** Yeah, for sure.

In your finances, that foundation is protecting income. Because if income disappears, everything else stops mattering. In that moment, people aren't thinking about retirement or long-term plans. They're thinking, "How do we pay the mortgage?"

That's why income protection is the foundation of the house.

### The Next Level - The Basics

The next level is the basics:
- Emergency fund
- Simple budget
- Will and power of attorney

These are the things that keep everything stable when life throws a surprise.

### Upper Levels

After that, we focus on:
- Getting rid of debt
- Planning for retirement and kids' education

### The Roof - Goals and Dreams

And at the very top, the roof of the house, are your goals and dreams:
- Trips
- Freedom
- Time

Because there really has to be more to life than just paying bills.

## 5. Problems with the House

At this point, most people are thinking, "Isn't this what everyone does?" And on the surface, it looks that way.

But once you zoom out, there are a few common problems we see over and over again.

### Insurance Gaps

A family might have life insurance, they're paying for it every month, but if you actually look at the coverage, it's often not enough to replace income or even pay off the mortgage.

So technically, they're insured. But practically, they're still exposed.

### Emergency Planning

When it comes to emergency savings and budgeting, most families are left to figure that out on their own. And because no one walks them through it, it usually gets pushed to the side.

Then something unexpected happens and the money comes from a credit card or line of credit. Not because people are careless — but because there was never a plan.

### Missing Legal Documents

It's similar with wills. Most people agree they're important. But because they feel expensive or complicated, they get delayed.

### Debt Without End Date

Most families don't actually know the exact date they'll be debt-free. They assume it's when the mortgage ends, and forget about everything else. And instead of helping people eliminate debt, most advice focuses on managing it.

### Investment Confusion

On the investment side, people are usually doing the right things. They're saving, they have accounts set up. But if you ask simple questions like, "What do you actually own?" or "How has this performed over time?" Most people aren't sure.

### Missed Opportunities

With kids' education, we see the same pattern. Money is being saved, but many families miss out on grants or incentives simply because no one explained them.

### The Two Biggest Issues

When everything else feels overwhelming, the roof of the house — the goals and dreams — gets pushed aside.

1. **Everything is spread across multiple companies and multiple advisors.** Each one focuses on their piece, but no one is coordinating the whole picture. It's hard to move forward when the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.

2. **There's no written plan.** Quick question: In all the years you've worked with financial institutions, how many times has someone sat down with you and given you a clear, written plan for everything?

## 6. How We Get Paid

Exactly. So here's what my team and I actually do when someone comes to us. We put a real plan together.

### What We Do

Most of the time, we're able to:
- Lower insurance costs
- Get wills and power of attorney in place
- Help people get out of debt faster
- Improve investment performance over time

And whatever money we free up, we redirect it toward things people actually care about — like trips, time off, or long-term goals.

### Value Proposition

If I was able to do that for someone you care about, would they be upset?

**Speaker 2:** No, of course not.

That's basically what we do. We look at everything together, from a big-picture point of view, and build a custom plan. The tools we use come from our head office, and there's no cost to the client for the planning itself.

### Referral Request

So if you happen to run into someone who could use this kind of help, I'd really appreciate an introduction.

Does anyone come to mind?

Thanks — I appreciate that. What's the easiest way for me to connect with them? Would an intro text or email feel best?

Perfect. That works.

### Team Building Opportunity

And just to mention it — some people also get curious about working with us. We're always looking for people who like helping others, enjoy learning, and want more flexibility.

If that ever comes up, here's how it works.

### Compensation Structure

We're paid based on volume. So the more people you help, the more you earn. On average, helping a family across a few areas can generate somewhere between $600 and $1,000. Sometimes more, sometimes less — it depends on the situation.

Most people are surprised by how little time it actually takes. Helping a client from start to finish is usually 4-6 hours, and it can all be done online.

There are no quotas, and people choose their own schedule.

### Recruitment Question

That's why, if you ever think of someone who's motivated, good with people, or likes teaching and learning, I'd be happy to introduce them to my manager for a quick conversation.

Does anyone like that come to mind?

## 7. The Sort

Out of everything we just talked about, what stood out to you the most right now?

### Qualifying Questions

Would you say it's looking at your own finances more closely?

Or are you more interested in the income or business side of things?

Or is it more that you're thinking about people you know who could use this kind of help?

---

## 8A. Client Scenarios

When someone identifies themselves as needing help with their finances, here's how to approach the conversation:

### Client Qualification

If they express interest in working with us directly:

1. **Acknowledge their interest** - "That's great that you see value in what we do. Many people find it helpful to have a second look at their financial picture."

2. **Explain the process** - "What I typically do is a complimentary financial review. We'll look at everything together - protection, savings, debt, and goals. There's no cost for this initial review."

3. **Set expectations** - "This usually takes about an hour, and at the end, you'll have a clear picture of where you stand and what options are available to you."

### Next Steps for Clients

- Schedule a follow-up meeting for the financial review
- Ask them to gather basic financial documents (current insurance policies, investment statements, etc.)
- Explain that they'll receive a written plan with recommendations

## 8B. Partner Recruitment

When someone shows interest in the business opportunity or seems like they'd be a good fit for the team:

### Identifying Potential Partners

Look for people who are:
- Motivated and goal-oriented
- Good with people and communication
- Interested in learning and personal growth
- Looking for flexibility or additional income
- Natural helpers or teachers

### Recruitment Approach

1. **Plant the seed** - "You know, some people who go through this process realize they'd actually be great at helping others with their finances. Have you ever considered anything like that?"

2. **Share the opportunity** - "We're actually expanding our team here in Toronto. We look for people who enjoy helping others and want more control over their income and schedule."

3. **Explain the business model** - "It's similar to a financial advisor role, but we focus on the complete financial picture rather than just products. The training is comprehensive, and you can start part-time while keeping your current position."

### Key Points to Emphasize

- **Comprehensive training program** - "You don't need previous financial experience. We have a structured training program that covers everything."
- **Flexibility** - "You can build this around your current schedule. Many people start part-time."
- **Income potential** - "Compensation is based on the families you help. Our average is $600-1000 per family, and you can help 1-2 families per week once you're established."
- **Support system** - "You'd be part of our team with ongoing support and mentorship."

## 8C. Referrer Scenarios

When someone is well-connected and could be a source of referrals:

### Referrer Qualification

Look for people who:
- Have large professional or social networks
- Are in positions of trust (accountants, lawyers, business owners)
- Are natural connectors who enjoy helping others
- Understand the value you provide

### Building Referral Relationships

1. **Understand their network** - "Tell me more about the people you work with. I'm curious about the types of professionals and business owners you're connected with."

2. **Identify ideal introductions** - "Based on what you've shared, the people who tend to get the most value from what we do are [describe ideal client]. Does that sound like anyone you know?"

3. **Make it easy for them** - "I'm not looking for you to sell anything. Just an introduction would be perfect. I can take it from there."

### Types of Referrers

**Professional Service Providers:**
- Accountants who see clients needing financial planning
- Lawyers handling estates or business transitions
- Mortgage brokers with clients needing protection
- Real estate agents helping families with home purchases

**Business Owners:**
- People with employee groups needing financial education
- Business owners with exit planning needs
- Network marketers with large downlines

**Community Leaders:**
- People active in churches, schools, or community organizations
- Volunteer leaders with broad networks
- People who organize networking events

## Key Delivery Notes for Team Members

- **Pace:** Speak naturally, not rushed. This should feel like a conversation, not a presentation.
- **Tone:** Warm, curious, and helpful. You're sharing valuable information, not selling.
- **Listening:** Pay attention to responses and adjust accordingly. This is a dialogue, not a monologue.
- **Transitions:** Use natural pauses to let concepts sink in.
- **Flexibility:** Be ready to spend more time on areas that resonate most with each individual.
- **Authenticity:** Use your own words while maintaining the core structure and message.

Remember: The goal is to build relationships and identify opportunities to help, whether through client referrals or team recruitment.
