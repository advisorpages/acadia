    <div class="dialogue-column">So, before we dive in… tell me a bit about yourself.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Sure. I'm married, we have three kids, and we own a home here in Toronto.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">What do you do for work?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">I'm a nurse at a hospital here in the city. I've been doing that for several years now.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">What do you like most about your current career?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">I like that the work actually matters. I'm helping people, and there's a real sense of purpose to it.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Definitely the hours. The shifts can be long and unpredictable, and I'd want more balance so I can spend more time with my family.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Do you have any kids? How old are they?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Yes — three kids. They're ten, seven, and five, so they're still pretty young.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">That's great. You must have your hands full.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">So if time and money were no issue at all… what would you and your family do differently?<br>What would that kind of freedom look like for you?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">We'd slow things down a bit. Spend more time together without worrying about schedules or money.<br>Travel more, be more present, and feel confident that our kids' future is taken care of.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">I understand.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Honestly, not anytime soon — at least not on its own.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">Do you have someone right now who handles your financial planning, other than yourselves?</div>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue-row">
    <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
    <div class="dialogue-column">No. We mostly handle things on our own, but we don't really have a clear plan.</div>
  </div>
