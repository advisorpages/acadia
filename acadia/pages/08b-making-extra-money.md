title: "Making Extra Money"
---

Speaker 1:
That's awesome.
Speaker 1:
Earlier, you mentioned wanting more time — to travel more and be more present at home.
Speaker 1:
Is it fair to say that's the main reason you're open to learning more about joining the team?
Speaker 2:
Yes.
Speaker 1:
If that were to happen, how much extra income do you think you'd need each month for that to feel real?
Speaker 2:
Probably about two thousand dollars a month.
Speaker 1:
That's fair.
Speaker 1:
What we'll do next is schedule a separate meeting to build out a more formal business game plan.
Speaker 1:
I'll walk you through our ninety-day training system in more detail, and I'll also introduce you to my broker — she's the one who signs off on all new hires.
Speaker 1:
But before we do that, I want to show you the business plan my broker shared with me about three years ago — the one that really got me focused on working here.
Speaker 1:
What appealed to me most about this business was the idea of passive income.
Speaker 1:
Are you familiar with what passive income is?
Speaker 2:
Not really.
Speaker 1:
In simple terms, passive income means the work you do today continues to pay you in the future.
Speaker 1:
That's one of the main reasons people are drawn to finance — very few industries offer that.
Speaker 1:
You can almost think of it like building your own pension.
Speaker 1:
Let me show you the plan I used to work toward a five-thousand-dollar-a-month passive income over sixty months.
Speaker 1:
When I sit down with a typical family — married, kids, full-time careers — they're usually saving about five hundred dollars a month between RRSPs, TFSAs, and their kids' education.
Speaker 1:
But there are usually four big problems.
Speaker 1:
First — they don't really know what they're invested in. They just know it's an RRSP or a TFSA.
Speaker 1:
Second — they're unclear on their five-year returns.
Speaker 1:
Third — many haven't seen their advisor since the account was opened.
Speaker 1:
And fourth — there's no written plan.
Speaker 1:
When you educate clients and give them clarity and structure, they typically stop saving at the bank and start saving with you.
Speaker 1:
Every time new money is deposited into the investment accounts we open, the investment companies pay us an average of about two percent.
Speaker 1:
Sometimes it's a bit more, sometimes a bit less — but two percent is a good average.
Speaker 1:
Let me break that down.
Speaker 1:
If a client redirects five hundred dollars a month and invests it through us, two percent of that is ten dollars.
Speaker 1:
By itself, that doesn't sound like much.
Speaker 1:
But here's the key — once people start monthly contributions, they usually don't stop. It becomes automatic.
Speaker 1:
Knowing that, my goal was simple: help just two clients per week with their investments.
Speaker 1:

That's five hundred dollars times two percent, times two clients — which equals twenty dollars.
Speaker 1:

If I did that consistently for one year — fifty-two weeks — that added up to about one thousand forty dollars per month in passive income.
Speaker 1:

And that's just from focusing on investments — an area where people desperately need guidance.
Speaker 1:

Now take that same approach and continue it for five years.
Speaker 1:

One thousand forty dollars multiplied by five years equals about fifty-two hundred dollars per month.
Speaker 1:

I remember asking myself — how long would I have to work at my IT job to earn a pension paying me fifty-two hundred dollars a month?
Speaker 1:

The answer was simple — never. They didn't offer one.
Speaker 1:

That's when this really clicked for me.
Speaker 1:

So if this is a plan we could realistically build for you, would you be interested in learning more about our ninety-day training system?
Speaker 2:
Yes.
Speaker 1:
Perfect.
Speaker 1:
Why don't you swing by the office this Thursday at seven p.m.
Speaker 1:
I'll introduce you to the team, and we'll walk through the game plan together.
