  <div class="dialogue-column">Everything we do is volume-based. That means the more people we help, the more we earn.</div>

  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">There's no salary and there's no hourly wage. You're paid based on the work you do and the value you bring. Compensation Breakdown</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Here's what that looks like in real terms.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Insurance — life, home, auto, and travel. Average payout is about five hundred dollars per client.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Wills and power of attorney. We work with a law firm. When you refer a client, the law firm pays about one hundred dollars.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>

  <div class="dialogue-column">Some people might just need insurance. Others might only need investments. Some need everything.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">But when you help a family across multiple areas, it's very realistic to earn around fifteen hundred dollars for that one family.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Even on the conservative side, most people average between six hundred and one thousand dollars per client.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Now here’s the part that surprises most people.</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Helping a client from start to finish usually takes between four and six hours total.</div>

</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-2">Speaker 2:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">Probably a few days.</div>
</div>

<div class="dialogue-row">
  <div class="speaker-column speaker-1">Speaker 1:</div>
  <div class="dialogue-column">For most people, that's several days of work.</div>
