00:00:02:08 - 00:00:29:01
Speaker 1
Sync one, two, three, four. Sing, sing, sync, sync one, two, three, four. Hey, guys. I put together this video to explain a little bit more about why I got into finance. And one of the benefits that a lot of people don't really realize that finance has a very unique way that they get paid. I think the assumption is, you know, you've got to sell your entire life and that kind of thing.

00:00:29:01 - 00:00:52:17
Speaker 1
But in reality, there's an end game when you're in the financial services industry and it's one of the most sought after reasons why people get started and end up staying in the industry. So, you know, I want to share with you why I did it. It didn't take it took quite a while. I was a bit slower, to be honest, but and I wasn't thrilled at the time, to be honest.

00:00:52:17 - 00:01:13:09
Speaker 1
Like, I mean, I didn't want to I didn't want to I don't want to sell my entire life, that kind of stuff. But when I realized and I understood this concept that I'm about to share with you, it really got me excited because, you know, I, I realized I'm going to have to work my entire life. I'm going to have to give about 30 to 40 years of my career to to a company.

00:01:14:07 - 00:01:39:09
Speaker 1
So sooner or later, I'm going to have to work hard anyways. And when I saw what I'm about to share with you guys today, it really appealed to me because I can take that 30 to 40 year career and collapse it into five. And, you know, at least that way, I mean, it wasn't at the time it wasn't a career change, but it was more of an idea of I could stop working and with a little bit of hard work, you know, that that would come true.

00:01:39:09 - 00:01:56:25
Speaker 1
And that was that's how it got started. And I ended up I ended up changing careers altogether when I when I was getting started. But I want to share this with you and for two reasons, is that obviously we're looking for more people and obviously I'm looking for more clients. And this I think this will give you a good idea of why I stuck around.

00:01:57:21 - 00:02:16:06
Speaker 1
And yeah, maybe you could share this with others. So anyways, I want to, I want to share this idea with you. If we take a look, this is not the entire product line that we have. We have about 16 different product lines. This is one product line and it's just investments. And it was a thing that I was very attracted to when I got started in finance.

00:02:16:17 - 00:02:43:10
Speaker 1
I really didn't care about the other things. I like the value that it brought, but I wasn't really passionate about it. But if we just take a look at investments, when we look at the in all the years that I've been dealing with people, when I sit with someone that's married or married, they're aged 25 or older. They've got kids, they're a homeowner, and they have a job or an occupation and a career that pays them at least $50,000 a year.

00:02:43:19 - 00:03:08:22
Speaker 1
If I look at that level of demographics, the typical family in this case, they save and they put away about $500 a month. And that's not uncommon because if you break it down for our RRSPs, let's say retirement registered retirement savings plans are as fees people are putting away about $200. So it's about $100 per year per couple upper per partner.

00:03:09:19 - 00:03:38:04
Speaker 1
They put away tax free, tax free savings accounts. Okay. And they're they're putting away $200 as well. And they're obviously sometimes they're putting away education plans for kids. So our spouse and they're doing about $100 there. So if you take a look at that entire thing, that's kind of usually how the $500 is broken down. Now, there's a problem, though, with most people we sit with.

00:03:38:04 - 00:03:56:16
Speaker 1
They have the accounts all set up. They're doing the right things. But I ask for very simple questions. Anytime I sit with someone who has some sort of investment, the first question I ask them is, you know, what is it that you own? Exactly. So you've got our RRSPs. You got to forces, you got RSP, all that. But what do you actually own?

00:03:56:26 - 00:04:15:20
Speaker 1
If you open up the hood, you pop open the hood of the car? What is it that you are putting your money into every single month? And they're not sure, really. So and you know, this is very common is that they just they put the money away. They think the RSP is the product. That's not true. That's something that you put into the products.

00:04:15:20 - 00:04:36:24
Speaker 1
So they're not sure what they own. Okay. That's number one. The second thing the second question I ask is what kind of returns have you had? And they can't answer that. They can tell you what their returns are over the last statement. But if you look at the if I ask them, you know, what's your rolling five year return?

00:04:37:08 - 00:04:55:19
Speaker 1
They can't answer it. So they're not really sure of the returns. Okay. That's the second challenge. And, you know, if you're putting money away, you want to know if it's doing right or wrong. Like if it's if you're on the right track or on the wrong track, they can't really answer. The third thing I asked them is, when was the last time you saw your advisor?

00:04:56:14 - 00:05:14:08
Speaker 1
And most of the time nowadays I'm giving people that well, I don't I don't have an advisor and there's no one guiding them. Or if they do have an advisor, they haven't seen them since the account was open. And that's generally a challenge for the most part. Now, this is different. If they're not reaching out to them, that's that's generally what we see.

00:05:14:21 - 00:05:32:17
Speaker 1
But sometimes you got the people that they're they are reaching out to them and they just don't call back, which I get a lot of. Right. But I'm calling them and I'm trying to service them. But the most part, most people nowadays don't have an advisor. There's no guidance. Right. And the fourth thing is they have no plan.

00:05:32:17 - 00:05:53:03
Speaker 1
And I asked them, do you have a written plan? What you want this particular money to do? You put away $200 a month into your RRSPs. What are you aiming for? You've got $100 a month going into your kids education plan. What do you want that to do for you? And the answer that I always get is, I just want a good return.

00:05:53:11 - 00:06:16:09
Speaker 1
And sometimes you don't need a good return to attain a specific goal. You need a consistent return and they can't answer those things. So generally, let me sit with someone. This is what we see. And there's a huge disconnect and there's a huge demand because almost everyone we sit with when I ask them these questions, this is exactly what I got.

00:06:16:17 - 00:06:36:20
Speaker 1
So there's a massive opportunity. And when I was taking a look at this over a decade ago and I decided I was going to do a bit of a career change, I saw, look, this is an opportunity if I just focus on this one area, I could I could build them. I could basically build my own pension. So give you a scenario here we sit with a client.

00:06:36:20 - 00:06:53:05
Speaker 1
We answer those questions. They realize, oh, my goodness, I didn't even know that. I'm like, I'm not doing the right things. So they say, Look, Anthony, just take this five I like. I'll stop it with the bank. I'm not going to give you Anthony, the my entire life savings, but I'll stop this $500 and I'll do it with you.

00:06:53:18 - 00:07:16:03
Speaker 1
And if you don't do a good job, I'm moving the money back. And that's a fair deal that I usually have with people. So if I sit if I if I help this one client, this one client, we get paid roughly about 2% of all the money that comes in. Actually, we put the 2% there. Okay. So we get paid 2% on the money that we transfer.

00:07:16:11 - 00:07:51:24
Speaker 1
So when that translates to 2% of $500 is $10, the around here is $10. Now that's $10. Every time they deposit the 500 and most time people are doing $500 a month. So every time they put the 500, that's $10. So that's a $10 passive income, if you want to say. And if we help two clients and my goal was working the evenings and the weekends, I could help two clients a week and two clients will pay me $20 a week just in this scenario.

00:07:52:00 - 00:08:12:22
Speaker 1
Okay. And if you multiply that, if you if you if I continue that and this is what I was thinking, if I continue that for 52 weeks, for one year, right. Any 52 weeks times 20, that's a thousand, 41,000, $40 a month paid to me possibly. And I looked at that. I'm like, crap, that's not bad. This is it.

00:08:13:02 - 00:08:27:23
Speaker 1
At the time that this was like a quarter of my paycheck or less than a quarter of my paycheck, and I'm like, should if I work hard for one year and I just get good at one area in an area that everyone needs help in, I could I could really I could really help a lot of people here.

00:08:27:23 - 00:08:50:18
Speaker 1
So and I can I can make a great passive income. I'm all for working hard and stopping eventually one day. But what I didn't like was the idea was that working in the call center, I'd have to take I'd have to work for 30 years to get maybe something at the end of the day, a pension. So I saw this and I started doing this, and I got close to a thousand bucks and I'm like, this is amazing.

00:08:50:19 - 00:09:07:26
Speaker 1
Like, I'm getting paid passively. My clients are happy. And when you have happy clients and you have people that are like people that you service that are happy, they naturally refer you to others, right? So that's kind of what happened. And my plan was like, if I do this for five years and I just help to clients a week for five years.

00:09:08:10 - 00:09:32:25
Speaker 1
So that's 1040. I'm a year is what I would do and I continue doing that for five years. That's 50 $200 a month and that's mortgage paid off automatically. And this passive guy's right, people who start putting money away, they forget about it. So this case, it's 50 $200 a month personally. And that was something that I was super excited about.

00:09:34:09 - 00:09:53:10
Speaker 1
This is I wouldn't have to work 30 years for a pension to do this. And especially nowadays, this is this is better than most pensions that are available today. And most companies now aren't offering pensions. So this is a way to generate passive income, whether you're you know, you're thinking about retirement and you need a constant cash flow coming in.

00:09:53:19 - 00:10:11:12
Speaker 1
This is a very stable way to generate passive without having to fork up a lot of capital. Okay. Now, this is if I did this personally. Okay? And, you know, you get to a point where, you know, I decided, look, I'll be a broker because if I start teaching people this stuff, I think I could change their life.

00:10:12:00 - 00:10:30:08
Speaker 1
So when I decided that I was going to become a broker, there's an incentive for us to develop people that do the same. So I started thinking, look, if I teach someone this exact game plan that I'm that I, I showed here right now, and I focus on building a team and let's say we just focus right now, just one person.

00:10:30:21 - 00:11:10:14
Speaker 1
Now, if I teach them to make 1040, okay, they make that money, right? What head office is going to do is they're going to pay me 30% of that volume, which comes up to an extra 312 bucks. That's $312. It's just make this cleaner 312 bucks. Okay. So every time I teach someone to make a thousand head office will pay me about 300 bucks.

00:11:10:16 - 00:11:49:19
Speaker 1
Okay. And if they stick to the same plan and they start making 5200, so they make 5200. Right. Head office is going to pay me $1,560 a month as I thank you or a kickback for servicing them. So I started thinking that and I'm like, if I started, if I just built a team of ten that do that, that's $15,600 a month working in a in an industry that people really need their help, they need the guidance.

00:11:50:13 - 00:12:06:20
Speaker 1
And in one product line, guys, keep in mind here, I'm not even including all the other stuff that comes in. A lot of times they have home an auto insurance. They have these ancillary these side products that, hey, by the way, do you know a mortgage broker? Yeah, I could refer you to one. And then there's money generated there.

00:12:07:13 - 00:12:36:16
Speaker 1
They have mortgage insurance. They don't know how it works or their policy's renewing and they need to get a renewal done, that kind of stuff. They pass it on. So this is 15,000 by focusing on building a team, teaching them the same thing that I'm doing and this is why I got I got involved in the industry is I realize I'm going to have to work hard sooner or later and I might as well work towards something that will pay me even when I stop working.

00:12:36:16 - 00:12:56:03
Speaker 1
So this was my pension plan. This plan was the thing that, you know, I feel that most people need. So, guys, thank you for watching this video. If you happen to know anyone like I will, I'm looking to build a bigger team. I'm looking at opening up a second branch. So if you happen to know anyone that wants to make some passive income, kind of like what I just shared with you today, I'd love to meet them.

00:12:56:11 - 00:13:13:15
Speaker 1
Obviously there's an incentive for me to do it and I would definitely guide them to the right way. Also, from a client perspective, guys, if there's anyone that you know that's kind of in this area, love to meet them as well. So I hope this kind of made sense a little bit. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.
