Hey, thanks for meeting up. I really appreciate you taking the time.

Before we get into anything, I just want to be clear — this isn't a sales meeting.

The reason I wanted to connect is pretty simple. I'm in the process of opening a new office here in __________, and part of that means getting to know people and understanding the community.

So today, I'll share a bit about what I do. And if along the way someone comes to mind who you think I should meet, or someone you think could use help, that's really all I'm looking for.

Does that sound fair?

So, before we dive in... I'd tell me more about yourself:

### Discovery Questions

<div class="question">
<strong>What do you do for work?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>What do you like most about your current career?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>Do you have any kids? How old are they if you don't mind me asking?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>If time and money were no issue at all... what would you and your family do differently? What would that freedom look like for you guys?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>Do you have someone right now who handles your current financial needs other than yourselves?</strong>
</div>

description: "Explaining the three possible outcomes of the meeting"

Thanks for sharing that. I know you're busy, so I'll keep this simple.

Usually, one of three things happens in meetings like this.

### First Outcome

I explain what I do, and along the way, you might think of someone who could really use the help. If that happens, I'd appreciate an introduction.

### Second Outcome

I'm in the process of building a team. So if someone comes to mind who you think would be a good fit to work with us, I'd love the opportunity to connect with them.

### Third Outcome

You might already be in good shape financially. But if there's one area that catches your attention, and you'd like me to take a closer look, we can do that too.

No pressure either way. You decide. Is that okay?

title: "The Financial House"
description: "Introducing the core financial house metaphor and structure"
---

One thing I notice with most people is that their money is kind of spread out everywhere. Different banks. Different accounts. Different advice.

So what I do is pretty simple. I help people organize everything into one clear structure that's easy to understand and follow.

The easiest way to picture it is like a house. I call it a financial house.

Just like a real house, every part has a purpose. And some parts matter more than others.

You'd agree the foundation is the most important part, right?

<span class="speaker-2"><span class="speaker-label">Speaker 2:</span>Yeah, for sure.</span>

In your finances, that foundation is protecting income. Because if income disappears, everything else stops mattering. In that moment, people aren't thinking about retirement or long-term plans. They're thinking, "How do we pay the mortgage?"

That's why income protection is the foundation of the house.

### The Next Level - The Basics

The next level is the basics:
- Emergency fund
- Simple budget
- Will and power of attorney

These are the things that keep everything stable when life throws a surprise.

### Upper Levels

After that, we focus on:
- Getting rid of debt
- Planning for retirement and kids' education

### The Roof - Goals and Dreams

And at the very top, the roof of the house, are your goals and dreams:
- Trips
- Freedom
- Time

Because there really has to be more to life than just paying bills.

title: "Problems with the House"
description: "Common issues people face with their financial structure"
---

If you look at this, you're probably thinking that every bank and financial advisor in Canada does this. Why would they want to pick me and my team? It's not obvious, but there's a bunch of problems with this house.

Let me give you a few examples:

### Insurance Gaps

Let's say this family has life insurance paying $300 per month. Experts suggest having coverage that's at least ten times your annual income. However, many families don't even have enough life insurance to pay off their mortgage if something were to happen to them.

When it comes to an emergency fund and budgeting, this family is left to figure it out on their own and as a result, they never get around to it. This is really important because if their house suddenly needed a $9,000 roof replacement, where would they find the money?

"Probably from a credit card."

That's right. Or maybe a line of credit. Having an emergency fund and written budget actually helps you stay out of debt.

### Missing Legal Documents

When it comes to a will, we all go to a lawyer to get one made. Most people agree it's important to have one, but very few actually do because it costs around $1,000 to get one made on this level.

### Debt Without an End Date

Let's say they have a mortgage and line of credit with TD Bank plus credit cards with Capital One and Amex. Most families don't know their debt freedom date, the exact date they'll be completely out of debt. They often assume it will be when the mortgage is paid off in 25 years. But they forget about the loans, lines of credit and credit cards.

The worst part is that no one wants to help with paying off debt. Instead, everyone is focused on increasing your credit limit.

### Investment Confusion

On the retirement side, they've put money into RRSP and TFSAs with TD wealth and they're part of a group pension with Manulife. But the problem is they're not really sure about their investments performance or what exactly they own.

They're left to figure it out alone, thinking they're doing fine with a 3 to 5% return on investment when they could actually be doing a lot better.

### Missed Opportunities

For their kids education, they have an account with RBC. Sadly, many families aren't getting help from government grants and bonds that are meant for education. It's not because they can't get it, but because they don't know about it.

Instead, they're putting their money in a regular savings account when they could be getting free money.

### Skipping Goals and Dreams

And the last part of the house is the roof for the goals and dreams. We find almost every family we meet with is so overwhelmed with the rest of their financial house, they skip goals like annual family trips, or maybe starting a business they've always dreamed of.

"Like I said earlier, there has to be more to life than just paying the bills, right?"

"Yes, I totally agree."

### The Two Biggest Problems

There's two big problems with this that aren't obvious.

**First problem:** Their finances are scattered over eight different companies and each company has a different agent with their own agenda. For example, if you were to meet with a life insurance agent, their main objective is to sell you the biggest policy they can offer. They don't care if you have debt or if you have a will.

If you go to the bank, their agenda is to get you into a new credit card or consolidate your debts into a line of credit. They don't really care if you have a will or life insurance. It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing.

**Second problem:** There's no written plan.

"In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debts, make the most of your investments, and save money on insurance?"

"Oh, my goodness. They never do that."

Exactly.

### The Solution

So here's what my team and I can do for the people you refer to me by putting together a plan. Typically, I can:
- Cut their insurance costs in half
- Put a will and power of attorney in their hands for about $200
- Get them completely out of debt with a mortgage in 20 years
- Get them a better return on all their investments, averaging roughly 6 to 9% in the long term

Also, all the savings we find by reorganizing their financial house, we put into their goals and dreams like a vacation fund or something like that. With the people you refer, would they be upset if I was able to do this for them?

"Of course not."

So basically that's what my team and I do. We fix most people's money problems by looking at their finances on a big picture and create a custom plan to fix it using tools our head office provides us entirely free for our clients. Pretty simple.

So if you happen to run into someone who needs this, I'd really appreciate an introduction.

Does anyone come to mind at all?

"Yeah. Me. We totally need one of these."

Oh, okay. For sure. I can put one together for you. What's your number? I'll call you during the week to grab some information when I'm free.

"Yeah, it's 4165, five, five. One, two, three, four."

Great. Thanks. Outside of you. Does anyone else come to mind at all?

"Maybe my brother and a few of my cousins."

What are their names?

"My brother is Jose. My cousins are Val and Eugene."

Great. I really appreciate that. What's the best way for me to connect with them? Can I give them a call?

"I think it might be best if I spoke to them first."

No problem. Instead, maybe you could send them an email introducing me instead. It might be less awkward and I don't want you doing too much work. Would you be okay to do that?

"Okay. Yeah. That's a better idea."

Great. Again, I appreciate it. You can also help by looking out for people who might want to join our team and help solve money problems for others. We're hiring. Our manager is doing phone interviews in the next few weeks and we'd love to meet anyone you think of. Let me show you how we get paid so you can tell others.

title: "How We Get Paid"
description: "Explaining the compensation model for team members"
---

Before we go any further, I think it's important to explain how we actually get paid.

### Volume-Based Compensation

Everything we do is volume-based. That means the more people you help, and the more areas you help them with, the more you earn.

There's no salary and there's no hourly wage. You're paid based on the work you do and the value you bring.

### Compensation Breakdown

Here's what that looks like in real terms.

**Insurance Services** (life, home, auto, travel):
- Average compensation: about $500 per client

**Wills and Power of Attorney:**
- We work with a law firm
- When you refer a client, the law firm pays about $100

**Mortgages:**
- We refer clients to licensed lenders
- When a mortgage closes, the lender pays around $400

**Investment Services** (retirement accounts, tax-free savings, education plans):
- Average compensation: about $500 per client

### Realistic Earnings

Now, not every client needs help in every single area. Some people might just need insurance. Others might only need investments. Some need everything.

But when you help a family across multiple areas, it's very realistic to earn around $1,500 for that one family.

Even on the conservative side, most people average between $600 and $1,000 per client.

### Time Investment

Now here's the part that surprises most people.

Helping a client from start to finish usually takes between 4-6 hours total.

There are no quotas. You're not forced to sell anything. And most of the work can be done online.

### The Value Proposition

So let me ask you something. In your current job, how long does it take to earn $600?

For most people, that's several days of work.

Here, it's one family.

That doesn't make it easy — but it makes it clear.

That's the compensation model. Nothing hidden. Nothing complicated. Just paid for helping people solve real problems.

Out of everything we just talked about, what stood out to you the most right now?

### Qualifying Questions

Would you say it's looking at your own finances more closely?

Or are you more interested in the income or business side of things?

Or is it more that you're thinking about people you know who could use this kind of help?

---
layout: chunk
title: "Client Scenarios"
description: "Working with potential clients who need financial help"
---

When someone identifies themselves as needing help with their finances, here's how to approach the conversation:

### Client Qualification

If they express interest in working with us directly:

1. **Acknowledge their interest** - "That's great that you see value in what we do. Many people find it helpful to have a second look at their financial picture."

2. **Explain the process** - "What I typically do is a complimentary financial review. We'll look at everything together - protection, savings, debt, and goals. There's no cost for this initial review."

3. **Set expectations** - "This usually takes about an hour, and at the end, you'll have a clear picture of where you stand and what options are available to you."

### Next Steps for Clients

- Schedule a follow-up meeting for the financial review
- Ask them to gather basic financial documents (current insurance policies, investment statements, etc.)
- Explain that they'll receive a written plan with recommendations

### Sample Language

"If you'd like, we could schedule a time to go through your specific situation. I find it's always helpful to have an objective third-party look at things. Most people discover either ways to save money they weren't aware of, or confirm that they're on the right track."

"Would you be open to sitting down for that financial review sometime in the next week or two?"

title: "Partner Recruitment"
description: "Building your team and recruiting potential partners"

When someone shows interest in the business opportunity or seems like they'd be a good fit for the team:

### Identifying Potential Partners

Look for people who are:
- Motivated and goal-oriented
- Good with people and communication
- Interested in learning and personal growth
- Looking for flexibility or additional income
- Natural helpers or teachers

### Recruitment Approach

1. **Plant the seed** - "You know, some people who go through this process realize they'd actually be great at helping others with their finances. Have you ever considered anything like that?"

2. **Share the opportunity** - "We're actually expanding our team here in Toronto. We look for people who enjoy helping others and want more control over their income and schedule."

3. **Explain the business model** - "It's similar to a financial advisor role, but we focus on the complete financial picture rather than just products. The training is comprehensive, and you can start part-time while keeping your current position."

### Key Points to Emphasize

- **Comprehensive training program** - "You don't need previous financial experience. We have a structured training program that covers everything."
- **Flexibility** - "You can build this around your current schedule. Many people start part-time."
- **Income potential** - "Compensation is based on the families you help. Our average is $600-1000 per family, and you can help 1-2 families per week once you're established."
- **Support system** - "You'd be part of our team with ongoing support and mentorship."

### Sample Conversation

"You mentioned you enjoy [their profession/hobby]. One of the things I love about this business is that it attracts people who are natural teachers and helpers. The skills you've developed in [their field] would actually transfer really well.

Would you be open to learning more about what we do? I'd be happy to introduce you to my manager for a casual conversation. No pressure at all - just a chance to see if this might be a good fit for you."

### Next Steps

- Schedule a meeting with you and your manager
- Have them review basic business information
- Discuss training timeline and income expectations
- Explain the licensing process if applicable

title: "Referrer Scenarios"
description: "Working with people who can refer clients or team members"
---

When someone is well-connected and could be a source of referrals:

### Referrer Qualification

Look for people who:
- Have large professional or social networks
- Are in positions of trust (accountants, lawyers, business owners)
- Are natural connectors who enjoy helping others
- Understand the value you provide

### Building Referral Relationships

1. **Understand their network** - "Tell me more about the people you work with. I'm curious about the types of professionals and business owners you're connected with."

2. **Identify ideal introductions** - "Based on what you've shared, the people who tend to get the most value from what we do are [describe ideal client]. Does that sound like anyone you know?"

3. **Make it easy for them** - "I'm not looking for you to sell anything. Just an introduction would be perfect. I can take it from there."

### Referral Incentives

Explain how referrals benefit both parties:
- "For anyone you introduce who becomes a client, I typically [mention any referral arrangement if applicable]"
- "More importantly, you're helping people you care about get access to comprehensive financial planning"

### Types of Referrers

**Professional Service Providers:**
- Accountants who see clients needing financial planning
- Lawyers handling estates or business transitions
- Mortgage brokers with clients needing protection
- Real estate agents helping families with home purchases

**Business Owners:**
- People with employee groups needing financial education
- Business owners with exit planning needs
- Network marketers with large downlines

**Community Leaders:**
- People active in churches, schools, or community organizations
- Volunteer leaders with broad networks
- People who organize networking events

### Sample Language

"Based on your work in [their field], I imagine you meet quite a few families who could benefit from having their financial picture organized. I'd love to be the person you think of when you come across someone who mentions needing help with their finances or insurance."

"If you ever come across someone who's good with people, interested in helping others, or looking for additional income, I'd appreciate an introduction. We're always looking for quality people to join our team."

### Maintaining Referral Relationships

- Follow up regularly (not just when you want something)
- Share success stories from people they've referred
- Be a resource for them when possible
- Show appreciation for introductions (even if they don't convert)
- Keep them updated on your business growth and services

### Long-term Strategy

Build a network of referrers who understand your value and can consistently introduce you to qualified prospects. The goal is to have multiple streams of referrals coming from different types of professionals and community connections.
