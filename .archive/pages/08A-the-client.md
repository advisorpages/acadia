When someone identifies themselves as needing help with their finances, here's how to approach the conversation:

### Client Qualification

If they express interest in working with us directly:

1. **Acknowledge their interest** - "That's great that you see value in what we do. Many people find it helpful to have a second look at their financial picture."

2. **Explain the process** - "What I typically do is a complimentary financial review. We'll look at everything together - protection, savings, debt, and goals. There's no cost for this initial review."

3. **Set expectations** - "This usually takes about an hour, and at the end, you'll have a clear picture of where you stand and what options are available to you."

### Next Steps for Clients

- Schedule a follow-up meeting for the financial review
- Ask them to gather basic financial documents (current insurance policies, investment statements, etc.)
- Explain that they'll receive a written plan with recommendations

### Sample Language

"If you'd like, we could schedule a time to go through your specific situation. I find it's always helpful to have an objective third-party look at things. Most people discover either ways to save money they weren't aware of, or confirm that they're on the right track."

"Would you be open to sitting down for that financial review sometime in the next week or two?"
