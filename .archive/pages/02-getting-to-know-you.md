So, before we dive in... I'd tell me more about yourself:

### Discovery Questions

<div class="question">
<strong>What do you do for work?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>What do you like most about your current career?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>Do you have any kids? How old are they if you don't mind me asking?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>If time and money were no issue at all... what would you and your family do differently? What would that freedom look like for you guys?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?</strong>
</div>

<div class="question">
<strong>Do you have someone right now who handles your current financial needs other than yourselves?</strong>
</div>
