Hey, thanks for meeting up. I really appreciate you taking the time.

Before we get into anything, I just want to be clear — this isn't a sales meeting.

The reason I wanted to connect is pretty simple. I'm in the process of opening a new office here in __________, and part of that means getting to know people and understanding the community.

So today, I'll share a bit about what I do. And if along the way someone comes to mind who you think I should meet, or someone you think could use help, that's really all I'm looking for.

Does that sound fair?
