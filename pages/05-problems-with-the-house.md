# Problems with the House

Common issues people face with their financial structure

---

If you look at this, you're probably thinking that every bank and financial advisor in Canada does this. Why would they want to pick me and my team? It's not obvious, but there's a bunch of problems with this house.

Let me give you a few examples:

## Insurance Gaps

Let's say this family has life insurance paying $300 per month. Experts suggest having coverage that's at least ten times your annual income. However, many families don't even have enough life insurance to pay off their mortgage if something were to happen to them.

When it comes to an emergency fund and budgeting, this family is left to figure it out on their own and as a result, they never get around to it. This is really important because if their house suddenly needed a $9,000 roof replacement, where would they find the money?

*"Probably from a credit card."*

That's right. Or maybe a line of credit. Having an emergency fund and written budget actually helps you stay out of debt.

## Missing Legal Documents

When it comes to a will, we all go to a lawyer to get one made. Most people agree it's important to have one, but very few actually do because it costs around $1,000 to get one made on this level.

## Debt Without an End Date

Let's say they have a mortgage and line of credit with TD Bank plus credit cards with Capital One and Amex. Most families don't know their debt freedom date, the exact date they'll be completely out of debt. They often assume it will be when the mortgage is paid off in 25 years. But they forget about the loans, lines of credit and credit cards.

The worst part is that no one wants to help with paying off debt. Instead, everyone is focused on increasing your credit limit.

## Investment Confusion

On the retirement side, they've put money into RRSP and TFSAs with TD wealth and they're part of a group pension with Manulife. But the problem is they're not really sure about their investments performance or what exactly they own.

They're left to figure it out alone, thinking they're doing fine with a 3 to 5% return on investment when they could actually be doing a lot better.

## Missed Opportunities

For their kids education, they have an account with RBC. Sadly, many families aren't getting help from government grants and bonds that are meant for education. It's not because they can't get it, but because they don't know about it.

Instead, they're putting their money in a regular savings account when they could be getting free money.

## Skipping Goals and Dreams

And the last part of the house is the roof for the goals and dreams. We find almost every family we meet with is so overwhelmed with the rest of their financial house, they skip goals like annual family trips, or maybe starting a business they've always dreamed of.

*"Like I said earlier, there has to be more to life than just paying the bills, right?"*

*"Yes, I totally agree."*

## The Two Biggest Problems

There's two big problems with this that aren't obvious.

**First problem:** Their finances are scattered over eight different companies and each company has a different agent with their own agenda. For example, if you were to meet with a life insurance agent, their main objective is to sell you the biggest policy they can offer. They don't care if you have debt or if you have a will.

If you go to the bank, their agenda is to get you into a new credit card or consolidate your debts into a line of credit. They don't really care if you have a will or life insurance. It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing.

**Second problem:** There's no written plan.

*"In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debts, make the most of your investments, and save money on insurance?"*

*"Oh, my goodness. They never do that."*

Exactly.

## The Solution

So here's what my team and I can do for the people you refer to me by putting together a plan. Typically, I can:
- Cut their insurance costs in half
- Put a will and power of attorney in their hands for about $200
- Get them completely out of debt with a mortgage in 20 years
- Get them a better return on all their investments, averaging roughly 6 to 9% in the long term

Also, all the savings we find by reorganizing their financial house, we put into their goals and dreams like a vacation fund or something like that. With the people you refer, would they be upset if I was able to do this for them?

*"Of course not."*

So basically that's what my team and I do. We fix most people's money problems by looking at their finances on a big picture and create a custom plan to fix it using tools our head office provides us entirely free for our clients. Pretty simple.

So if you happen to run into someone who needs this, I'd really appreciate an introduction.

Does anyone come to mind at all?

*"Yeah. Me. We totally need one of these."*

Oh, okay. For sure. I can put one together for you. What's your number? I'll call you during the week to grab some information when I'm free.

*"Yeah, it's 4165, five, five. One, two, three, four."*

Great. Thanks. Outside of you. Does anyone else come to mind at all?

*"Maybe my brother and a few of my cousins."*

What are their names?

*"My brother is Jose. My cousins are Val and Eugene."*

Great. I really appreciate that. What's the best way for me to connect with them? Can I give them a call?

*"I think it might be best if I spoke to them first."*

No problem. Instead, maybe you could send them an email introducing me instead. It might be less awkward and I don't want you doing too much work. Would you be okay to do that?

*"Okay. Yeah. That's a better idea."*

Great. Again, I appreciate it. You can also help by looking out for people who might want to join our team and help solve money problems for others. We're hiring. Our manager is doing phone interviews in the next few weeks and we'd love to meet anyone you think of. Let me show you how we get paid so you can tell others.
