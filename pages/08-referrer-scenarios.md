# Referrer Scenarios

Working with people who can refer clients or team members

---

When someone is well-connected and could be a source of referrals:

## Referrer Qualification

Look for people who:
- Have large professional or social networks
- Are in positions of trust (accountants, lawyers, business owners)
- Are natural connectors who enjoy helping others
- Understand the value you provide

## Building Referral Relationships

1. **Understand their network** - "Tell me more about the people you work with. I'm curious about the types of professionals and business owners you're connected with."

2. **Identify ideal introductions** - "Based on what you've shared, the people who tend to get the most value from what we do are [describe ideal client]. Does that sound like anyone you know?"

3. **Make it easy for them** - "I'm not looking for you to sell anything. Just an introduction would be perfect. I can take it from there."

## Referral Incentives

Explain how referrals benefit both parties:
- "For anyone you introduce who becomes a client, I typically [mention any referral arrangement if applicable]"
- "More importantly, you're helping people you care about get access to comprehensive financial planning"

## Types of Referrers

**Professional Service Providers:**
- Accountants who see clients needing financial planning
- Lawyers handling estates or business transitions
- Mortgage brokers with clients needing protection
- Real estate agents helping families with home purchases

**Business Owners:**
- People with employee groups needing financial education
- Business owners with exit planning needs
- Network marketers with large downlines

**Community Leaders:**
- People active in churches, schools, or community organizations
- Volunteer leaders with broad networks
- People who organize networking events

## Sample Language

"Based on your work in [their field], I imagine you meet quite a few families who could benefit from having their financial picture organized. I'd love to be the person you think of when you come across someone who mentions needing help with their finances or insurance."

"If you ever come across someone who's good with people, interested in helping others, or looking for additional income, I'd appreciate an introduction. We're always looking for quality people to join our team."

## Maintaining Referral Relationships

- Follow up regularly (not just when you want something)
- Share success stories from people they've referred
- Be a resource for them when possible
- Show appreciation for introductions (even if they don't convert)
- Keep them updated on your business growth and services

## Long-term Strategy

Build a network of referrers who understand your value and can consistently introduce you to qualified prospects. The goal is to have multiple streams of referrals coming from different types of professionals and community connections.
