# The Financial House

Introducing the core financial house metaphor and structure

---

One thing I notice with most people is that their money is kind of spread out everywhere. Different banks. Different accounts. Different advice.

So what I do is pretty simple. I help people organize everything into one clear structure that's easy to understand and follow.

The easiest way to picture it is like a house. I call it a financial house.

Just like a real house, every part has a purpose. And some parts matter more than others.

You'd agree the foundation is the most important part, right?

*Yeah, for sure.*

In your finances, that foundation is protecting income. Because if income disappears, everything else stops mattering. In that moment, people aren't thinking about retirement or long-term plans. They're thinking, "How do we pay the mortgage?"

That's why income protection is the foundation of the house.

## The Next Level - The Basics

The next level is the basics:
- Emergency fund
- Simple budget
- Will and power of attorney

These are the things that keep everything stable when life throws a surprise.

## Upper Levels

After that, we focus on:
- Getting rid of debt
- Planning for retirement and kids' education

## The Roof - Goals and Dreams

And at the very top, the roof of the house, are your goals and dreams:
- Trips
- Freedom
- Time

Because there really has to be more to life than just paying bills.
