I appreciate you being upfront.

I build my business on trust,
not pressure.

Who’s one person you know —
a family member or colleague —
who’s feeling stressed about their money right now?

I’d be happy to offer them
the same education we talked through today.

Thank you.

What’s the easiest way for me to connect with them?

Would an introduction feel best,
or would you prefer I reach out directly?
