Thanks for sharing that.

I know you’re busy,
so I’ll keep this simple.

[Pause 1 second]

Usually,
one of three things happens in conversations like this.

[Pause 2 seconds]

First —
I explain what I do,
and along the way,
you might think of someone
who could really use the help.

If that happens,
I’d appreciate an introduction.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Second —
I’m in the process of building a team.
So if someone comes to mind
who you think would be a good fit to work with us,
I’d love the opportunity to connect with them.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Or third —
you might already be in good shape financially.
But if there’s one area that catches your attention,
and you’d like me to take a closer look,
we can do that too.

[Pause 2 seconds]

No pressure either way.
You decide.

[Pause 1 second]

Is that okay?
