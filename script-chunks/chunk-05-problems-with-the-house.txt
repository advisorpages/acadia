At this point,
most people are thinking,
“Isn’t this what everyone does?”

[Pause 1 second]

And on the surface,
it looks that way.

[Pause 2 seconds]

But once you zoom out,
there are a few common problems
we see over and over again.

[Pause 1 second]

Let me walk you through a simple example.

[Pause 1 second]

A family might have life insurance.
They’re paying for it every month.
But if you actually look at the coverage,
it’s often not enough to replace income
or even pay off the mortgage.

[Pause 2 seconds]

So technically,
they’re insured.
But practically,
they’re still exposed.

[Pause 2 seconds]

When it comes to emergency savings and budgeting,
most families are left to figure that out on their own.

[Pause 1 second]

And because no one walks them through it,
it usually gets pushed to the side.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Then something unexpected happens.
A big repair.
A surprise expense.

[Pause 1 second]

And the money comes from
a credit card
or a line of credit.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Not because people are careless —
but because there was never a plan.

[Pause 2 seconds]

It’s similar with wills.

Most people agree they’re important.
But because they feel expensive or complicated,
they get delayed.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Debt is another big one.

Most families don’t actually know
the exact date they’ll be debt-free.

They assume it’s when the mortgage ends,
and forget about everything else.

[Pause 2 seconds]

And instead of helping people eliminate debt,
most advice focuses on managing it.

[Pause 2 seconds]

On the investment side,
people are usually doing the right things.

They’re saving.
They have accounts set up.

[Pause 1 second]

But if you ask simple questions like,
“What do you actually own?”
or
“How has this performed over time?”

Most people aren’t sure.

[Pause 2 seconds]

With kids’ education,
we see the same pattern.

Money is being saved,
but many families miss out
on grants or incentives
simply because no one explained them.

[Pause 2 seconds]

And when everything else feels overwhelming,
the roof of the house —
the goals and dreams —
gets pushed aside.

Trips.
Time off.
Ideas people always meant to explore.

[Pause 2 seconds]

And that brings us to the two biggest issues.

[Pause 2 seconds]

First —
everything is spread across
multiple companies
and multiple advisors.

Each one focuses on their piece,
but no one is coordinating the whole picture.

[Pause 2 seconds]

It’s hard to move forward
when the left hand
doesn’t know
what the right hand is doing.

[Pause 2 seconds]

And second —
there’s no written plan.

[Pause 1 second]

So quick question.

In all the years you’ve worked with financial institutions,
how many times has someone sat down with you
and given you a clear,
written plan
for everything?
