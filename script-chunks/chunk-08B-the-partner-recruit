Let me share this from my own perspective,
because this is the part that really made sense to me.

[Pause 1 second]

When I first looked at this business,
I wasn’t interested in selling everything
or trying to do too much.

What caught my attention
was the idea of focusing on one area,
doing it properly,
and building something that lasts.

[Pause 2 seconds]

For me,
this wasn’t about quick income.
It was about doing work today
that would still matter later.

Almost like building my own pension.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Here’s how I looked at it.

When I sit with a typical family —
they’re working,
they own a home,
they might have kids —
most of them are already saving money.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Usually around
five hundred dollars a month.

That money is already going into things like
retirement accounts,
tax-free savings,
or education plans.

They’re doing the right things.
They just don’t always have clarity
around what they own
or whether it’s really working the way they expect.

[Pause 2 seconds]

So my focus was simple.

Help people organize what they’re already doing,
put a clear plan around it,
and start small.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Most of the time,
they’d say,
“Let’s just start with this five hundred
and see how it goes.”

[Pause 2 seconds]

Now here’s the part that changed how I thought about income.

On that five hundred dollars,
I’m paid two percent.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Two percent of five hundred
is ten dollars.

So every month that family continues saving,
I earn ten dollars.

[Pause 2 seconds]

At first,
that didn’t sound like much.

[Pause 1 second]

But then I realized something.

That ten dollars shows up every month —
not because I keep selling,
but because I did the work properly once.

[Pause 2 seconds]

So I set a very realistic goal for myself.

I wanted to help
about two families a week.

Nothing extreme.
Evenings and weekends.

[Pause 2 seconds]

That works out to
around eight families a month.

At ten dollars per family,
that’s eighty dollars a month.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Now here’s where it started to click for me.

If I stayed consistent for one year,
I’d have helped about
ninety-six families.

[Pause 2 seconds]

At ten dollars per family,
that’s roughly
nine hundred and sixty dollars a month
coming in.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Not because I was working more hours —
but because the work stacked.

[Pause 2 seconds]

And if I kept that same pace
for five years,
I’d be helping about
four hundred and eighty families.

[Pause 2 seconds]

At that point,
that’s around
four thousand eight hundred dollars a month
in ongoing income.

[Pause 2 seconds]

For me,
that’s when it stopped feeling theoretical
and started feeling practical.

[Pause 2 seconds]

I wasn’t chasing commissions.
I was building something stable
in a professional industry
that genuinely needs good people.

[Pause 2 seconds]

I’m sharing this with you
not to convince you,
but to show you how I thought about it.

[Pause 2 seconds]

If that kind of long-term approach
lines up with how you think,
then it’s worth a deeper conversation.

[Pause 2 seconds]

And if not,
that’s completely fine too.

[Pause 2 seconds]

The next step, if you’re curious,
would just be to meet my broker,
see how the support works,
and ask questions.

[Pause 2 seconds]

No pressure —
just clarity.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Would you be open to doing that?
