[Pause 2 seconds]

Hey, thanks for meeting up.
I really appreciate you taking the time.

[Pause 1 second]

Before we get into anything, I just want to be clear —
this isn’t a sales meeting.

[Pause 1 second]

The reason I wanted to connect is pretty simple.
I’m in the process of opening a new office here in Toronto,
and part of that means getting to know people
and understanding the community.

[Pause 1 second]

So today, I’ll share a bit about what I do.
And if along the way someone comes to mind
who you think I should meet,
or someone you think could use help,
that’s really all I’m looking for.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Does that sound fair?
