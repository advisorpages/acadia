Before I explain anything,
I’d love to get to know you a little better.

Tell me a bit about yourself.

[Pause]

What do you do for work right now?

[Pause]

What do you enjoy most about it?

[Pause]

If you could change one thing about what you’re doing,
what would that be?

[Pause]

Financially speaking,
do you feel like you’re where you want to be?

Ideally,
how much would you like to be earning?

[Pause]

Do you have kids?

[Pause]

How old are they?

[Pause]

Let me ask you something I always find interesting.

If time and money weren’t an issue at all,
what would life look like for you and your family?

[Long pause]

Thinking about your current path,
when do you feel that becomes possible for you?

[Pause]

And one last thing,
just so I understand the full picture —
do you have someone helping you with your finances right now,
or are you handling everything yourselves?

[Pause]
