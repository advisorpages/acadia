Before we go any further,
I think it’s important to explain
how we actually get paid.

[Pause 1 second]

Not as a pitch —
just so you understand the model.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Everything we do is volume-based.

That means the more people you help,
and the more areas you help them with,
the more you earn.

[Pause 2 seconds]

There’s no salary
and there’s no hourly wage.

You’re paid based on the work you do
and the value you bring.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Here’s what that looks like in real terms.

[Pause 1 second]

On the insurance side —
things like life, home, auto, or travel —
the average compensation works out to
about five hundred dollars per client.

[Pause 2 seconds]

For wills and power of attorney,
we work with a law firm.

When you refer a client,
the law firm pays
about one hundred dollars.

[Pause 2 seconds]

For mortgages,
we refer clients to licensed lenders.

When a mortgage closes,
the lender pays
around four hundred dollars.

[Pause 2 seconds]

On the investment side —
things like retirement accounts,
tax-free savings,
and education plans —

the average compensation
is about five hundred dollars per client.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Now, not every client needs help
in every single area.

[Pause 1 second]

Some people might just need insurance.
Others might only need investments.
Some need everything.

[Pause 2 seconds]

But when you help a family
across multiple areas,
it’s very realistic
to earn around
fifteen hundred dollars
for that one family.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Even on the conservative side,
most people average
between six hundred
and one thousand dollars
per client.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Now here’s the part
that surprises most people.

[Pause 1 second]

Helping a client
from start to finish
usually takes
between four and six hours total.

[Pause 2 seconds]

There are no quotas.

You’re not forced to sell anything.

And most of the work
can be done online.

[Pause 2 seconds]

So let me ask you something.

[Pause 1 second]

In your current job,
how long does it take
to earn six hundred dollars?

[Pause 3 seconds]

For most people,
that’s several days of work.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Here,
it’s one family.

[Pause 2 seconds]

That doesn’t make it easy —
but it makes it clear.

[Pause 2 seconds]

That’s the compensation model.

Nothing hidden.
Nothing complicated.

Just paid for helping people
solve real problems.
