One thing I notice with most people
is that their money is kind of spread out everywhere.

Different banks.
Different accounts.
Different advice.

[Pause 1 second]

So what I do is pretty simple.
I help people organize everything
into one clear structure
that’s easy to understand and follow.

[Pause 1 second]

The easiest way to picture it
is like a house.

I call it a financial house.

[Pause 2 seconds]

Just like a real house,
every part has a purpose.
And some parts matter more than others.

[Pause 2 seconds]

You’d agree the foundation
is the most important part, right?

**Speaker 2:**
Yeah, for sure.

**Speaker 1:**

In your finances,
that foundation is protecting income.

Because if income disappears,
everything else stops mattering.

[Pause 1 second]

In that moment,
people aren’t thinking about retirement
or long-term plans.

They’re thinking,
“How do we pay the mortgage?”

[Pause 2 seconds]

That’s why income protection
is the foundation of the house.

[Pause 1 second]

The next level is the basics.

An emergency fund.
A simple budget.
A will.
And power of attorney.

[Pause 2 seconds]

These are the things
that keep everything stable
when life throws a surprise.

[Pause 2 seconds]

After that,
we focus on getting rid of debt.

Then planning for retirement
and kids’ education.

[Pause 2 seconds]

And at the very top,
the roof of the house,
are your goals and dreams.

Trips.
Freedom.
Time.

[Pause 1 second]

Because there really has to be
more to life
than just paying bills.
