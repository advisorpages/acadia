CHUNK 2: GETTING TO KNOW YOU SURVEY (Approx. 2-3 minutes)

[Pause for 2 seconds]

So, before we dive in... I'd love to understand a bit more about your situation. Let me ask you a few questions to get to know you better.

[Pause naturally]

What do you do for work?

[Give them space to respond]

That's interesting. What do you like most about your current career?

[Listen actively]

If you had a magic wand and could change anything about it, what would you change?

[Pause and listen]

Are you making all that you want to make right now? If there's a gap, how much more would you like to be earning?

[Give them space to think]

Do you have any kids? How old are they if you don't mind me asking?

[Listen warmly]

If time and money were no issue at all... what would you and your family do differently? What would that freedom look like for you guys?

[Pause for reflection]

When do you see your current career allowing you to accomplish those kinds of things?

[Listen thoughtfully]

Do you have someone right now who handles your current financial needs other than yourselves?

[Pause 3 seconds for response]
