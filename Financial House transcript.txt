Speaker 1
On the client side, I often notice that people's money is spread out everywhere, making it difficult for them to manage. I help them by setting up a simple structure that's really easy to follow. Basically, I build financial houses for people. It's like creating your dream home, but instead for money. Just like a regular house. Each floor and each room has its own priority, with some being more important than others.

Speaker 1
You'd agree that the foundation is probably the most crucial part, right?

Speaker 2
Yeah, sure. That makes sense.

Speaker 1
In finance, experts all agree that life insurance is the foundation of a financial house. If something happens to you and your income disappears, your family won't be thinking about things like retirement. They'll be scrambling, trying to figure out how to pay the mortgage without the proper type and amount of life insurance. The rest of the financial plan won't matter because the family is suddenly in survival mode.

Speaker 1
That's why life insurance is the foundation of the home. It's needed to replace the income of a loved one in case they die. The second floor of the financial House includes an emergency fund, a budget, a will and power of attorney. These are important for keeping your finances safe and ready for any surprises. The next floor level is getting rid of debts, then planning for retirement and kids education.

Speaker 1
And finally, the roof of the house is your goals and dreams. Because there has to be more to life than just paying the bills. Right. If you look at this, you're probably thinking that every bank and financial advisor in Canada does this. Why would they want to pick me and my team? It's not obvious, but there's a bunch of problems with this house.

Speaker 1
Let me give you a few examples. Let's say this family has life insurance with sun life paying $300 per month. Experts suggest having coverage that's at least ten times your annual income. However, many families don't even have enough life insurance to pay off their mortgage if something were to happen to them. When it comes to an emergency fund and budgeting.

Speaker 1
This family is left to figure it out on their own and as a result, they never get around to it. This is really important because if their house suddenly needed a $9,000 roof replacement, where would they find the money?

Speaker 2
Probably from a credit card.

Speaker 1
That's right. Or maybe a line of credit. Having an emergency fund and written budget actually helps you stay out of debt. When it comes to a well, we all go to a lawyer to get one made. Most people agree it's important to have one, but very few actually do because it costs around $1,000 to get one made on this level.

Speaker 1
Let's say they have a mortgage and line of credit with TD Bank plus credit cards with Capital One and Amex. Most families don't know their debt freedom date, the exact date they'll be completely out of debt. They often assume it will be when the mortgage is paid off in 25 years. But they forget about the loans. Lines of credit and credit cards.

Speaker 1
The worst part is that no one wants to help with paying off debt. Instead, everyone is focused on increasing your credit limit. On the retirement side, they've put money into RRSP and Tfsas with TD wealth and they're part of a group pension with Manulife. But the problem is they're not really sure about their investments performance or what exactly they own.

Speaker 1
They're left to figure it out alone, thinking they're doing fine with a 3 to 5% return on investment when they could actually be doing a lot better for their kids education. They have an account with RBC. Sadly, many families aren't getting help from government grants and bonds that are meant for education. It's not because they can't get it, but because they don't know about it.

Speaker 1
Instead, they're putting their money in a regular savings account when they could be getting free money. And the last part of the house is the roof for the goals and dreams we find. Almost every family we meet with is so overwhelmed with the rest of their financial house, they skip goals like annual family trips, or maybe starting a business they've always dreamed of.

Speaker 1
Like I said earlier, there has to be more to life than just paying the bills, right?

Speaker 2
Yes, I totally agree.

Speaker 1
There's two big problems with this. That's not obvious. The first problem is their finances are scattered over eight different companies and each company has a different agent with their own agenda. For example, if you were to meet with a life insurance agent, their main objective is to sell you the biggest policy they can offer. They don't care if you have debt or if you have a will.

Speaker 1
If you go to the bank, their agenda is to get you into a new credit card or consolidate your debts into a line of credit. They don't really care if you have a will or life insurance. It's really hard to get your finances in order when the left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing. And the second problem is there's no written plan.

Speaker 1
In all the years you've been with your bank, how many times have you been offered a written plan to help you pay off debts, make the most of your investments, and save money on insurance?

Speaker 2
Oh, my goodness. They never do that.

Speaker 1
Exactly. So here's what my team and I can do for the people you refer to me by putting together a plan. Typically, I can cut their insurance costs in half, put a will and power of attorney in their hands for about $200. Get them completely out of debt with a mortgage in 20 years and get them a better return on all their investments.

Speaker 1
Averaging roughly 6 to 9% in the long term. Also, all the savings we find by reorganizing their financial house, we put into their goals and dreams like a vacation fund or something like that. With the people you refer, be upset if I was able to do this for them haha.

Speaker 2
Of course not.

Speaker 1
So basically that's what my team and I do. We fix most people's money problems by looking at their finances on a big picture and create a custom plan to fix it using tools. Our head office provides us entirely free for our clients. Pretty simple. So if you happen to run into someone who needs this, I'd really appreciate an introduction.

Speaker 1
Does anyone come to mind at all?

Speaker 2
Yeah. Me. We totally need one of these.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay. For sure. I can put one together for you. What's your number? I'll call you during the week to grab some information when I'm free.

Speaker 2
Yeah, it's 4165, five, five. One, two, three, four.

Speaker 1
Great. Thanks. Outside of you. Does anyone else come to mind at all?

Speaker 2
Maybe my brother and a few of my cousins.

Speaker 1
What are their names?

Speaker 2
My brother is Jose. My cousins are Val and Eugene.

Speaker 1
Great. I really appreciate that. What's the best way for me to connect with them? Can I give them a call?

Speaker 2
I think it might be best if I spoke to them first.

Speaker 1
No problem. Instead, maybe you could send them an email introducing me instead. It might be less awkward and I don't want you doing too much work. Would you be okay to do that?

Speaker 2
Okay. Yeah. That's a better idea.

Speaker 1
Great. Again, I appreciate it. You can also help by looking out for people who might want to join our team and help solve money problems for others are hiring. Manager is doing phone interviews in the next few weeks and we'd love to meet anyone you think of. Let me show you how we get paid so you can tell others.

Speaker 1
It all depends on volume. The bigger the transaction, the more you make. On average, for insurances like life, home, auto and travel. You earn about $500 per client for referring wills. The law firm pays about $100 for referring mortgages. The lenders pay about $400 for retirement investments like RRSP and TFSAS and kids education plans like RRSP, you earn about $500.

Speaker 1
So for helping a family with everything you can earn around $1,500 per client. Realistically, you might not help everyone in all areas, but you can still expect to make about $600 to $1000 per client. How long does it take for the average person to make a minimum of $600 in their job today?

Speaker 2
That's easily four days worth of work.

Speaker 1
Exactly. To help a client from end to end takes 4 to 6 hours and they can choose their own hours. No quotas, and they'll have the option to do it all online through Zoom. Now, my hiring manager isn't looking for just anyone. She wants a very specific type of person. We're looking for someone who is a good salesperson or good at teaching others, someone who is enthusiastic, ambitious or motivated.

Speaker 1
Does anyone like that come to mind?

Speaker 2
So what does this person need to do exactly?

Speaker 1
Basically, just put plans together using the tools that the company gives us. Do you have someone in mind?

Speaker 2
Honestly, I think I might be interested in this, but I want to learn more about it before committing to anything.

Speaker 1
Oh, okay. That's fine. I think it's best for you to talk to the hiring manager, Jeanette, so she can answer all your questions. She handles everything. She's doing phone interviews this week, so it would be good to speak with her. If I can set up a meeting, would you join the call?

Speaker 2
Yes, absolutely.

Speaker 1
Is it okay if I pass on your number to her?

Speaker 2
Yeah, sure. That would be okay.

Speaker 1
Aside from you, is there anyone else who comes to mind?

Speaker 2
Yeah. I was thinking about my cousin Tony and my brother in law, Sam. I think they'd be really good at this.

Speaker 1
Okay, great. What's the best way to get a hold of them? Is it okay if I give them a call?

Speaker 2
Yeah, that should be okay. I'll text you their number.
